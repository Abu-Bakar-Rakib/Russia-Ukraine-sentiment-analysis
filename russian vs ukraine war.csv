"Big Satan is the US, Little Satan is Israel!"
Reminds one of a meeting between Adolf and Benito.
Actually Erdogan is a Vulture waiting to gobble up the remains. Putin is Far more of what you see is what you get. Western press has Vilified the man .... for Years. Cuz he is Russian
"To whom it may concern Proud of the state of the world, do you think the world is special and exclusive to you? O you who take pride in the temporary blessings and state of the world, do you think that the world is reserved for you and handed over to you? When did the world cease to be a state of the greedy, do you think that your essence is necessary for this world? When did this world become devoid of the greedy, do you think that you are so necessary to this world? The most unexpected discovers the secrets of your inner world, Do you think that everyone is blind and the world is stupid? The most unexpected discovers your inner face, Do you think that everyone is blind and the people are stupid? One day you will also be miserable, O rosebud, do you think that this society is eternal? One day you too will be miserable, Oh rosebud, do you think this community will always be like this [with you]? If I were to be shameless to the king, do you think that you and I would be sad? If I were to be a coward, if I were to be grateful to this wheel (cycle), do you think that I would be saddened by your cruelty? The helper of the one who trusts in Allah is God, The unhappy heart will one day be happy. The helper of the one who trusts in Allah is Allah, The sad heart will one day be happy. Ziya Pasha (1825-1880)"
"A lot of crowing but none of you have done anything, neither NATO nor the UN, no one at all, looking the other way, a lot of talking and not acting out of fear, courage is and IRAN has it, thank goodness, let it do what it must do and do, don't get involved now, thank you and thank you IRAN"
People who read the holy bible know Russia and turkey are joining with Iran
"After Iran falls, only Turkiye, and the infidels in the House of Saud remain to be conquered."
Ezek 36 to 39
"Ezekiel 48 tells us God will win the battle, not russia,iran,turkey"
Putin thinks hes a world leader...he cant even keep his own corner of the world peaceful
I aint fighting in this war... Lock me up
Erdogan always gets the anti -Israel propaganda out when he wants to manipulate his voters and get elections closer.
"The saying, &quothave the right to defend themselves&quot says everything about the mentality of inferiority."
Hasnt PuZin been stabbed in back more than once by Retjep the last treachery was breaking a promise 2 to hand over VOZA 2 Voldermort
"Please refrain from calling islamic Republic Iran, these scum backs are not iranian, they are bunch of arab"
"Ardeghan you are next, shut the front door"
"Alas, russia is spent. Unless..."
"Erdogan, champion in empty words"
2 big mouth guy don’t align yourself with these two they will sell you look the other war. Putin disappointed me
Diplomacy isn’t possible with Netanyahu
"Iron dome: Excuse me, I cannot work under pressure"
Russia is crazy. Stop your war before you comment on another war
We don’t want an age old civilization being decimated by some newly formed countries who wanted to rewrite history not by their contribution to the world but by suppressing others.
"kim say,from trump came he has not mentioned him yet hahahaa&quotrunning scared the little rocket man jibe,realize"
USA is about to go bye bye.
lol RUSSIA has an opinion ?
All talk does nothing. They should support Iran just like the us is supporting israel
How can Putin talk about peace when he is trying to take over Ukraine?
At least Russia and Turkey agree while our President escalates.
Turkey is part of Iran.
Istanbul Islamabad Tehran Brothers
Putin...the best of all time.
Said a guy who did not use diplomacy with Ukraine
Putin and nethanyahu both have great relationship both doing same work
Putin is a half Jew himself!
I hope Iran allies supply them with effective modern equipments because Iran helped them in their battles with drones not just lip service
Diplomacy with satan yahu !!! Get real
"Who cares what these two clowns have to say? They are completely irrelevant. When US and Israel flattens Teheran in next couple of hours, they will give two &quotstrong&quot statements and Arabs will become silence as the bottom of the ocean"
Even Russia do not want nuclear Iran.
"The presidents of Turkiye and Russia have held a phone call discussing the latest developments in the conflict between Iran and Israel. 
 Both leaders agreed that diplomacy must bring the fighting to an end as soon as possible&quot. Putin, Diplomacy? Yeh right! Two of the worlds greatest tyrants are now preaching diplomacy to the world, and typically, the media give them lots of airtime!"
So dictator ayatola khamenie begging erdogan and poutin to stop israel
Russia and Israel 6 and 9
Erdoğan munafeq muslim......
Turkish leader erdogan he is nt muslim he is mixing person he seitan that's why Turkish people must be change the leader erdogan is puppet
This women are bias Putin and iran are very good friend they has been friends for long time it not for putin political gain putin iran china all are not interested in war only setanyahoo usa west love war so what political gains if it peace
Diplomacy failed. Isreal is not playing this time. Russia has its problems with Ukraine.
We have to live in a world where Putin and Erdogan are peacemaker
er dog an
Before peace talk all menber must remove lawless law body and all country must build international laws U.N criminal law thats serve justice equality humanity. If not dont waste time lawless law
Turkey’s erdogan is disgraceful to Muslim ummah he’s a supporter of evil
RUSSIA MUST WITHDRAW FROM UKRAINE AND CYPRUS WHILE TURKEY MUST LEAVE CYPRUS BOTH OCCUPYING POWER AND OCCUPYING FORCES ILLEGAL UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND U.N CHARTER.
Iran Stay strong Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Erdogan is just a talker. This guy has not done anything in the whole Gaza conflict.
I-ran trying to run away from its problems
Russia doesn’t want Iran wasting their drones.
A little too late
Iran is begging for mercy
Erdogan is a double edged sword. He cant be trusted at all.
But Turkiye and Russia are afraid of Israels might
Turkey is all talk and King Abdullah from Jordan is a coward.
Os americanos causaram isso pra fazer o Irã se opor a suas regras acho que poderia controlar a guerra na Ucrânia putin continua a tomar e tomar mais território é tomar a decisão certa
Sadly there is no sane voice left anymore. In earlier times it was India which would bring countries together because everyone respected them but now India too is in the pockets of Israel. Russia is compromised too. China has been a big disappointment. It’s an emerging superpower and yet it doesn’t act like one. It should have given the world an alternate but it failed to do so. Turkey is all words no action. It has sold its soul like the Arab kingdoms. It’s a sad state of affairs. Dark days ahead for humanity.
Israel wins
One talker another bustard
ISRAEL N@zis attacked Iran 1st. Iran has the Power and Right to defend itself
Its d matter of transgressor trangrress beyond bounds
why are they talking of diplomacy when they can even solve the wars they started? they even not in the position to be the person to talk when it comes to diplomacy.
Turkey no action talk only..we saw what you do at palestinian
Diplomacy. Hahaha. Any ceasefire without the overthrow of the Iran government put the mossad at risk
When she said international sanction that mean the West The West is what they call the world the west is what they call the civilized world remember what the European president called the outside world Europe is the basket so where is this journalism and this export about Russia Iran come from who are these people that know the history they just born Thats a young woman
"Freedom &amp justice to Palestine, Iran. ignore hasbara, paid bots and trolls"
"In a world of injustice, iran is a beam of hope"
"Only problem for Iran is that there own allied cant help them like USA, uk, Germany,france e.t.c will help Israel."
Too late for that! US birds incoming and Regime change now! The paper tiger has fallen!
Turkey is next after Iran. The islamist regime of Erdogan is in danger
"Whothefuckis Erdogan? Putin you say ok, but the other 1d1ot? I don't think so"
Nothing to do only for i Wash
The zionist are the alien invation the world has been talking about.
How does two bullies talk about diplomacy? Hypocrisy of the highest order.
two dictators for life
The only language Nazinyahu knows is violence
The most stupid and useless Presidents
Ever wonder if Iran got their hands on the Epstein Files when they took all those Israeli secret files. I mean there sre millions of files belonging to Mossad and other Israeli agencies. There has to be something about Epstein in there!
"This two guys has no ccks. No balls. Shame to see iran having to deal alone with enemies. No balls with russia, china turkey, northkorea. Failure in geopolitics. Shame on you."
Hippocrates
Putin is a war criminal and is doing the same to Ukraine
There is no diplomacy with terrorism. Israel is a terrorist state.
"If russofascists killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than zionazis killed Palestinian children, does that mean that russia is four times less fascist than israel?"
"Putin and Russia will stop recognizing Israel and save Palestine, preventing the destruction of Iran very soon, Inshallah. All Israelis will have to return to Europe and America."
"I think Russia and a lot of other oil producing companies, love what’s going on oil will go higher and that Will enrich they pocket at the end of the day. They don’t care about children and innocent people dying. It’s always about the money. Russia supposed to be partners with Iran why are they not helping Turkey never helps anyone in the Middle East if anything they help Israel."
"Both this guys are always concerned, but do nothing about the genocide in Palestine or anyone else"
"Im an American veteran, and i havent seen a war so easy by taking over another country air space.The Iranian regime should be a shame of themselves they are worth less, they have no military strategy whatsoever."
No one is coming to Irans rescue with this war. They spent years building destabilizing proxy groups to threaten Israel with and now that they are all neutralized they are vulnerable and everyone knows it.
I feel bad for turkiye people why vote for such horrible president
"By all respect mr Erdogan, in this cases u are speaking nonsense. Diplomacy was there and mr Netanyahu have use that to plan this attacks. So how will be your reaction if this have make to you Israel ?"
"Actually, Russia and Turkiye are supporting Iran against Israel in the diplomatic way, although its not so obvious. Trump helped Russia a lot in the Russo-Ukrainian war by stopping the military aids to Ukraine, and Turkiye is even a member of Nato, therefore, both Mr Putin and Mr Erdogan wouldnt help Iran so obvious in order to avoid stimulating America, and thats understandable"
"Pootin can only talk, he proved to be useless."
Erdogan
Turkey are snakes. Scumbags.
"Iran helped russia when the entire west stood against him seeing him quite after iran been attacked is mind blowing, Mr putin after all kamikaze drone from iran you cant supply iran even with single anti air craft interceptor"
Yes Putin doesn’t want Israel to damage his terror drone operations against Ukraine.
But Putin should stay away from this. He's busy harassing his neighbor but want peace talks with distant people.
Putin don’t trust Hypocrite Edrogan who is NATO member
Russia is being useless
Aljazeera is hunting for supports for Iran. The world knows that Aljazeera is the number one hater of Israel. Aljazeera cant stop Israel from defending itself.
aka youre on your own
"Ya ya bla bla , It's their turn and Qatar"
Long live Iran
"Europe united, but the Middle East didn’t — so they are being targeted one by one: first Palestine, now Iran, next could be Saudi Arabia, and eventually the entire region."
"So isnotreal , america and other wsetern countries can gave nuclear program but iran cant really hypocritical statement"
"There is no diplomatic cure or solution to the expansionist, neo-colonist, ethno-supremacist, financial and resource-greed aspirations of the West (inclusing Israel, North America, UK, wesern Europe, Australia and New Zealand)."
watermelon seller keeps talking empty words
Turkey is responsible for what is happening in Middle East.
These two dumbasses phone each other.
Has being a mediator ever worked?
Diplomacy don’t work against Israel the US and the UK while Russia china Iran turkey and arab countries go for diplomacy the west including Israel is trying to destroy the world 1 country at a time
Turkiye only talks talks n talks . Help iran militarily
Aur do gann?
Stop genocidal state
Russia needs to stop its own war. As for Turkey there is no love lost between Iran and Turkey.
This reporting makes me yawn. This is a big nothing burger.
"Aljazeera is promoting Israel from the beginning, very clear by their news and inviting guests. Your time will come one day as you are promoting Israel crime."
It seems Russia invested a lot in Iran and doesnt want the demolition to continue
Iran coward muslim countries leaders are licking the boots of US and its western allies
Putin the peacemaker
Erdogan only talk no action ali khamenei only action no talk
This lady seems very naive. Putin will display a desire for a diplomatic solution publicly but behind the scenes he will try to fuel the conflict in hopes of diverting Western resources and efforts away from Ukraine. Those who dont see that are blind.
"Erdogan and Putin talking about mediating and sovereignty, oh what a joke X)"
Russia just has to make sure that America stays out of this.
"Turkey government Erdogan No Muslim should trust this double-faced Erdogan, he only tells lies to save his government, American Dog Erdogan"
Be baptised by full emersion and receive receive gift of the holy spirit speaking in tongues
"Israel doesn’t want diplomacy cos Iran was already in diplomatic talks with USA when isreal attacked them, so why are they still talking about this diplomacy. Hypocrite people."
"I think that Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Russia, Türkiye, and the Muslim world, together, should teach Israel a lesson by avoiding just lip service."
Erdogan the biggest bag of hot air traitor the same stop supplying oil and diapers Subahan Allah
Erudugan is frustrated
The bully aka Israeli nazism must be penalised
No diplomacy for the one who attacking!!
"Turkey is a hypocrite, and Russia is a traitor. Talk is cheap"
Putin shouldnt say anything he should be among the people speaking peaceful resolution bse themselves they have refused cease fire in Ukraine.
"Erdogan is a stabber camaleon. He can be trusted. Russia has to be careful with that opportunistic who would betray anybody. He doesn't embrace real friends somehow he has isolated himself in his bargaining game. He would love to be treated like a little king but the west hates him. Russia and China have been patient with this fool but they know he can snitch on them once offered more money. There will come a time when he has to side with someone but he will do like coward Spanish Franco who played both side leaning towards Hitler but a total coward. At the end, because of him, Spain was left out from the UN power share. The britz would love to sink Erdogan ego because they hate him and his nation as much as they hate Russia. Time will tell."
Okay mr Putin then go make peace with Ukraine first...or are you just as hypocrite as his zionist masters
Turkey should decide either support iran or Israel not playing games
Two cowards
Moscow just needs to shutup and deal with their own problems.
Diplomacy is death
Bible prophecy unfolding minute by minute. The Lamb reigns victorious!
Russia talking about diplomacy? Wow!
"Nations talk about diplomacy, Trump talk about a deal. Just like any business, Trump Mobile launched!"
Is erdogan a zios’ muppet?
"BiBi knows his political career would end, if he fails to win this war. So, he tries to drag Trump into the fray with False claims about &quotTrump Assassination Bid&quot"
"Turkey shivered badly witnessing isreals precise and deadly response claiming top islamic regime officials from intelligence, military, i bet Erdogan would peed in his trouse if this happened between isreal and turkey"
Allah is helping israel control Iranian air space
Iran has the right to defend.
Both of these rats can f off. peace throw what not being alive.
Israel doesnt understand diplomatic language because America is main devil behind to keep hold in Middle Eastern oil.
Not sure Russia is the best choice for mediator here.
"Israel’s actions are causing many problems, and without stopping them, peace is not possible.
 Russia, China, and Turkey should now stand beside Iran and offer support in this difficult time."
"They arent talks about diplomacy. They are talks about the next excallation, strategy-coordination, and jump in."
Erdoğan parrot
"Most of y’all in the comments, don’t make sense. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. We’re all pretending like Iran is a good country so let’s just stop that first of all, and on top of that Iran is ran by terrorist group. We all know that to be true too they use fear That’s their number one tactic and that’s how they stay in control. Do y’all really want Iran to have a nuclear weapon? On top of that, how is Russia is going to try to hold peace talks between Iran and Israel and they can’t even solve their own problem with Ukraine. It makes no sense for you to sit up here and say hey let me lead the talks between Israel and Iran and you can’t even come up with an agreement with Ukraine. It makes no sense. Focus on that first. The only reason why they probably want to hold the talk is because they benefit from Iran! they need Iran oil for their war and weapons"
this is supposed to be relevant news? What diplomacy? Putin doesnt use dimplomacy in his own war but wants to mediate for Iran and Israel? There is no reason for Iran to accept and forgive Israels behavior
"Most of y’all in the comments, don’t make sense. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.

Focus on that first. The only reason why they probably want to hold the talk is because they benefit from Iran! they need Iran oil for their war and weapons"
But they cant do the same thing for Palestinians hypocrites leaders with double standards
Iran is Great power full
Innocent people of iran stay safe ... the world with you... its not your fault that your government put you in this position
"We dont know if Rusia is helping Iran, I hope they help them, because the Jews get help from US, UK, France and Iranian are just fitting alone, these gang is dangerous for the world."
ERdogan always wants to be a good guy. He cannot be trusted.
Talk talk talk.
WHY IS THIS TERRORIST SUPPORTER NATO MEMBER TALKIN WITH PUTIN? ERDOGAN IS AN ISLAMIC TERRORIST SUPPORTER
"Israel should never take this action This action as the starting of war , now gave Iran justifications to rally Arabs, Russia and Chinese to support. All Arab States behind the scene will side with Iran. Not smart move israel."
"I think Iran is the most reliable ally of Russia, as Iran demonstrated in standing fully with the Russians during the Russian bad times. Iran-Russian partnership is more than military cooperation, I think. If Iran needs, Russia might even give 100s of Nuks to Iran, as Iran delivered Shahid Kamikaze drones and ballistic missiles for Russia during the bad time, when everyone ignored Russia and enemies want to erase Russia."
Imagine Netanyahu hiding in a bunker
Turkey is useless and Erdogan is a hypocrite
Give Iran military support
EasyRussia Turkey Iranworking for IsraelCould bring peace
They are enjoying both
"F* Erdogan, only talking"
"I dont think there is a permanent solution because the US and Israels aim was always a change of regime in Iran. The aim remains the same regardless of Iran having or not having a nuclear program. Otherwise, the previous agreement with Iran, which was limiting enrichment, was perfectly okay to resolve the problem, but it was Trump who pulled out of it following Israels guidance."
The only country that is trustworthy in the negotiation is Oman.
Will diplomacy bring back the dead? Will it please those who were unalived? Stop lying. All these other people are just trying to convince Putin to not get involved.
Help of Erdogan and Putin never reached Gaza despite it literally turned into graveyard. Perhaps they are now also waiting for another Gaza to come up making hollow promises to Iran.
Two traitor
full support to iran
"thank you Israel ,im a muslim and i support Israel"
Putin must end his war in Ukraine. This looks awkward
"Iran never spoke war,Isreal always spoke war he even sold the idea of killing leaders of countries he considered enemies to their puppet Trump,Isreal want to pull the world into a world war."
Yulia shapaealoa is great girl
"1) I wish the MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL FRIENDSHIP between Russia and Iran WILL BE LONG LASTING!!! I wish the MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL FRIENDSHIP between China and Iran WILL BE LONG LASTING!!!

S. is DIMINISHING!!!"
Russia can never be trusted. Western countries always help their friends and allies.
Putin talking about diplomacy is the bigggest joke of the year.
"Diplomacy doesn’t work with narcissistic beasts, primitive instinctive beings."
Neranyahu does not give a hoot for the likes of Putin and Erdogan and may not even answer their phone calls.
Erdogan the empty talker and Putin the oppurtunist.
"Diplomacy does not work with Israhell. Only military power will sort this out, not diplomacy"
Erdogan is just big mouth good for nothing...the first week of attack on Gaza by Israel the first one who issued the statement was Erdogan saying death is coming to Israel anyday we will knock at your door...now two years passed thousand of innocent children and women killed in Gaza and Erdogan is still on the way...he is just a big actor on the world screen nothing more than statement..
erdogan and putin only speaking then finished no values
An Iran-supporter and an Iran-proxy walk into a bar...
israel gonna talk and then start an attack again and then play the victim card and call for its father america.
Ayatollah can join Assad in Moscow
Putin as well diplomacy against Ukraine. Fair deal
The west dont do diplomacy only evil.
"Sorrows and disgrace shall be Netanyahus portion from today, peace will be far from him and his bloodline, every innocent Palestinian blood he spilled shall stand against him in this life and the life after for the Prophet of the most high God have called him out and reported him to the highest authority in the mighty name of Yeshua Hamashiach who the world calls Jesus Christ."
"If Trump wants the Iran-Israel conflict to end, its simple dont send weapons to Israel."
Love to hear Macron &quotflirting around during G7
"One has Afghan and Ukrainian blood on its hands, the other Armenian — and they dare to talk about diplomacy."
"aljazzera is very unhappy... another horrible dictator is being removed. First hitler, then assad, then khamenei... poor poor aljazzeera"
"I wasnt financial free until my 40s and Im still in my 40s, bought my third house already, earn on a monthly through passive income, and got 4 out of 5 goals, just hope it encourages someones that it doesnt matter if you dont have any of them right now, you can start TODAY regardless your age INVEST and change your future!Investing in the financial market is a grand choice I made."
Iran = I Ran Away
"Those Turkish cowards have no place in this, theyve been helping the enemy since day 1 till now with oil and gas, among 100s of other trade deals going on to this very moment."
So Iran wants a cease fire already? Who would have thought?Meanwhile millions of Iranians are starting to be displaced These people NEVER learn
Israel is the terrorist state
"Is genocide and starvation of children in Gaza still going on?How many residential buildings were destroyed by Israel in Gaza?How many people, including children and women, were burnt alive in Gaza by Israel?Has Israel allowed international media to be allowed to report from GAZA?Israel attacked civilians in Iran, and Iran has the right to self-defense , right?"
WHY IS TURKEY WITH NATO ?????? THEY NEED TO GTFO
No one will believe you both in Israel. Just evacuate your ally kamenei
Who the f is Erdogan he is not able to save Palestine trying to mug up everywhere who takes him seriously
Why not activated before
Russia is getting rich off them high oil prices.
They might just help Iran
"Send them to Allah, and let him sort it all out."
I get visions of Ali Tollah and Assad walking in Moscow together - arm in arm
"And this is news worthy, why?"
They need to arrest the Netanyahu War criminal and stop the killing of both side civilians....
Fact: Russia has a large Jewish population in Israel Fact : Russia has the ability to store nuclear materials found Fact: Russia does not agree with Iran having a nuclear weapon. Fact: There is no western country that could mediate as a neutral mediator that Iran would trust. Is the goal is to find a permanent solution agreeable to all or to buy time. The issue should not be Putin. It should be peace.
Why did Turkey not arrest Putin on the world court order? Putin has an active international court order for his arrest.
"Not to trust Erdogan. He is a Munafiqin. Russian, we need to be careful, Iran now this chance will never come. Disable Israel completely . The Munafiqins Arabs will respect Iran. Font trust Modi."
Give iran time to teach israel first do not get rush
Erdogan and Putin. Talk is cheap.
Isreal is loosing that’s why they want the fight to stop
Mulle Unite here
"Iran is righteous, ethical, moral, noble, and virtuous, and is on the right side of history from England"
Turkey helping IranYou make me laugh Turkey is rubbing his hands to see Iran destroyed
Ironic given Putin and Erdogan’s visions of “Diplomacy”. Nevertheless we all want peace in the Middle East.
Putin is a fool and Russians should depose of him asap. If he stays in power more of humiliations like the bombers getting destroyed few weeks back are gonna happen to Russia. Remove the fool and put Medvedev in his place.
Erdogan is a yelper. Nothing more nothing less.
Erdugan. You hypocrite. May Iran be the saviour of Palestine.
Biased kathmulla Erdogan.. Turkey is a NATO member.
"Once, this joker promoted Diriliş: Ertuğrul just to boost his popularity in the Muslim world.Then Erdoğan stated his dream about to restore the Ottoman Empire after 2022 But… but… but… he forgot that he is not even good enough to perform the Turkish ice cream act!🍦"

"WARS, PAST &amp NOW -2025 ?? Mans inhumanity Makes countless thousands mourn A piece of earth made to live Weve earned our historys scorn. Were the bad boys of the planet Who walk in shoes upright We differ only in our posture From beasts that feast at night. After death our name lives on In the records of our nation Or in the genes of a child A rebirth of creation. Sometimes we must go against the flow Questioning what our shepherd’s may say. For they are not God, only human As for their integrity, we pray. With honor we obtain uprightness By love and compliance, we gain grace. Integrity gives us proper goals Improving the standard of our race. Some ask why must we study history It just encourages us to live in the past.

"Very important lesson for every country and every individual to learn fast: Relationships are often about ever-changing selfish interests and rarely about selfless friendship! Saddam, Ghadaffi, Osama, Assad, etc. all learned that the hard way! Bosom friends today and mortal enemies tomorrow!"
"The world should now choose Russia as the superpower, because America does not have the qualities that a superpower should have. Best world leader Mr. Putin sir."
"Turkey is a shameless country, Nobody can Trust them"
Is this a joke? Putin. Putin is asking for de-escalation? HAHAHAHA
No way Israel should be allowed to teach Iran a bitter lesson so that next time they we obey what ever decisions or proclaimanation the US give Iran must adhere to it because they had been sponsoring terrorist around the world so they can be trusted with nuclear power
"Iran has reached out to Oman and Qatar, requesting that they mediate with Washington in an effort to halt the ongoing Israeli strikes and restart nuclear talks"
Erdogan has been calling Pakistan to form alliance against Israel 🇮🇱 today what makes him pacifist?
The chosen one who god apparently has anointed king prophet and false messiah of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu is now commanding his useful idiots like America and the Americans to lay down their life’s and money for Israel once again…🤦🏼‍♂️
Erdogan
No diplomacy until after isnotreal has been crippled.
Israel is a bully and needs to be stopped once and for all
"The invisible sides of war: because we refuse to learn.From Hanoi to Gaza.When America entered the war in Vietnam, it stepped into a conflict it didn’t understand. No grasp of the people. No grasp of the land.No idea how deeply rooted resistance can be when a nation is defending its home. Today, we see echoes of that same miscalculation. Putin believed Ukraine would fall in days. Netanyahu flirts with the idea that regime change in Tehran—by killing a few key leaders—could be swift and surgically successful. But war doesn’t unfold in straight lines. In Vietnam, the more bombs America dropped—B-52s, Napalm bombs , carpet bombing—the more resilient the Vietnamese became.It happened again in Iraq. Again in Afghanistan. The “mother of all bombs” was dropped. And still, more Afghans rose and won.From that wreckage came the Taliban. Came ISIS. Ghosts of wars that were meant to be won. Because here’s the hard truth: A foolish leader starts a war first—and calculates the cost later. War fueled by its own ashes.Victory on the battlefield it doesnt mean winning the war. And without that… the war is never truly over….."
Unprovoked attacks...
"Ezekiel 38And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,2 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,3 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:4 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them all of them with shield and helmet:6 Gomer, and all his bands the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.7 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.8 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.9 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.10 Thus saith the Lord GOD It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought:11 And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,12 To take a spoil, and to take a prey to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants"

"Meanwhile: Through closed iranian airspace, two chinese military cargo planes (Airbus 330-243F) covertly landed in Iran after having switched off their transponders over Turkmenistan."
Erdoğan always trying his best for peace
Why Turkey has become Turkiye? Turkiye is not in English language
Dont meddle. No diplomacy needed here.

Russia ignoring Iran for their temporary gain.they don’t even blast Israel verbally after sending of patriots to Ukrain.if russia want to oppose US hegomony they hv to strengthen Iran with air defences not with words

"We need to make a quick decision to stop the war, not just by talking on the phone."
Every country needs to back off and let Iran deal with Israel. US stay out of this conflict. IRAN can resolve this on their own. maybe then Israel will think long and hard before declaring war on a sovereign nation.

"What a joke - psychopath Putin who ordered the Russian attack and invasion of Ukraine is calling for &quotdiplomacy&quot between Israel and Iran.The whole idea is insane, and an insult to the intelligence of the human race. What kind of fools do you take us for?"

It is clear that Israel has become the most powerful terrorist organization in the Middle - East
The Iranian are shaking up The Israeli air force are flying all over Iran without any....Israel going on the regime change Bye-bye Iran
India is spreading a lot of fake news and ai generated fake videos about Pakistan turkey guys so be careful dont believe in whats been shown over India news channels
"Erdogan and Putin coming together for mediation means US/Israel are fighting a losing game. They are out to rescue US/Israel from bad entanglement.. Both are US double agents, out to cause more harm to Iran than good."
This is the big Iran
Russia is powerless......
Iran
At toothless bulldog Russia bogged down in a special military operation trying to be a PEACE broker ? You cant make this up
They will not do anything.
"Turkiye, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and for many other Islamic countries, Iran was a headache because of its military might and economic growth. No doubt they playing double games!"
How Iran is destroying Israel and making Gaza
I wish I had friends like Iran
Rule #1: Never trust The United States Of IsraelRule #2: Dont forget Rule #1

"Oil prices fall Gold prices rise, global currencies fall"
Russians get VERY upset when their lies are not believed.
News media play important role in conveying unbiased messages to the world. Misinformation and propaganda lead to continuation of war.
Stop lying its zeleski n his masters nato n us!! Ukrainians r dying while zeleski s wife is shopping in Milan Paris n London!! Russia has destroyed all nato n us tech weapons!!! B care L the oreshnik will visit al nato countries @@ who is going to stop Russia!!???
Russia and Ukraine need only one thing: Thats peace agreement with no foreign influence.
"To be fair, Ukrainian people have NO ACCESS TO non NATO mainstream media.. they have been brainwashed. There is no reason for banning Russian media sources unless the Ukraine government and NATO government are afraid of narratives which challenges the NATO/Ukraine narrative"
"Ukraine won’t even pay for there dead soldiers, disgraceful, what incentive do Ukraine’s have to fight when there own government declares there sacrifice worthless"
"Russia is currently taking 5 miles a day, lollllllllllllll these idiots are a disgrace"
Watching these shows with the ridiculously skewed views and narratives lacking any publicly available facts and stated formal positions incl. strategic directions.Anyone can see both sides of the conflict. These people onpy choose to see one side.
Wheres the evidence that Russia was losing 1000 men a day? This is Western propaganda.
Western propaganda at its best. The casualties are the opposite of what you report - up to 1.2 million Ukrainians and 200 thousand Russians
"The boring old meat grinder bs again, the retarded never read the room"
Did I just hear right the Ukranian man mentioned that Russia has lost around 1.4 million soldiers and Ukraine only tens of thousand when discussing payment for fallen soldiers... What reverse world are these guys living in?
Russia had to send its bots here because apparently they’re marching down Kyiv parade style
"Weldone Ama Boateng,greetings from Ghana 🇬🇭"
"Ukraine must rally Western troops to defend themselves, otherwise they’re DOOMED."
"Russia had 180,000 soldiers on the beginning of the war. After recruiting and training, they had a maximum of 1 million army in Ukraine . According to Ukraine and pro-ukraine sources, they lost 1million solders. Why is war still going on if Ukraine is so successful killing almost the entire Russian army on the battle field."
AJ no credibility left with these &quotexperts&quot(liars ) and the silence on the terror reign in Syria
"Can you stop with the usual pro-war speakers? fed up with S Erlanger, he is fossil working for Washington. None of them make sense at this point. Some names for you: Jeffrey Sachs, Glenn Diesen, John Mearsheimer, any Ukrainian opposition leader, Aaron Mate, Gilbert Doctorow, Alistair Crook"
This so called analysts forget that people or the audience watching have access to other sources of information. I think it’s foolish and speaks more the credibility of the person when spewing random numbers in the hope it will advance a narrative to favour one side.
"This is really pointless and waste of time, all 3 speakers on the panel were in agreement and had the same viewpoints in favour of Ukraine and against Russia. I thought Aljazera will provide a balanced perspective and discussion relative to all the other shows from DW, France 24 and others from EU and US, but I was wrong. Even for the most lame and uninformed person would conclude to be a therapeutical discussion in support of Ukraine."
1% THOROUGHLY pacified...meaning never coming back to zelensky....
"DO NOT EXPECT that---it was the kremlin that made the occupation when it retired its veto in the age when there was NO Afrikan or Asian voices, the Moscowvite SSRs persistently voted to transfer europeans from, Europe to another colony they even forgot that they themselves had a policy under JAO. I can tell you now, categorically that the kremlin will NOT sit-back and watch the dismantling of the Caspian entente at the behest of their great western rivals. However, the puny occupation under the non interference terms, can still defend herself... this has always been the agreed rule, but Moscow NEVER played fair, and consistently betrayed the Arabs courtesy of the paradigms of JAO, but, ever since 1991 the Kremlin is under no foundational illusions, it will not butter the western colonial toast...."
"God have mercy on the Ukrainians. We know there is nothing difficult before God, since God has witnessed wars since time immemorial and stopped many many He intervene this time in Ukraine"
"Aljazeera editor and director please you guys credibility is at risk, we are all for the under dog, but you cant be impartial on Gaza and become very partial on Russia-Ukraine war, any viewer would detect the propaganda, bring equal analyst from each side, and dont be repeating Nato Ukraine propaganda."
America deceived Ukraine. Russia will take Ukraine if America fails to correct this mistake.
Ho are dose people? I day have not clo what is going on in Russia or Ukraine Way day not say NATO AMERICA against Russia
Extremely stupid propaganda.
Russia honestly disappointed some of us who initially thought was a big super power country.
Its a shame seeing russia a self claimed super power swapping more than 1000 prisoners each with armless Ukraine. This shows how weak russia military is .
NONE
The figures she started with 1 million dead russians were enough for me to stop the video. bullshit propaganda
The moment you say Russia lost more than Ukraine. Then you know this is just silly propaganda
"Those figures from the West are wrong, its just propaganda, we saw bodies handed to Ukraine yesterday."
Aljazeera is the most useless and nonsensical media In the planet anyone listing tho them is doing himself harm because they are full of lies and misleading masses. They have done more harm than good to this planet.
Al jazeera is fully biased now.
This is not enough for Zelensky and he’s going to lose more of his friends and supporters
MACGREGGOR GAVE A DIFGFERENT NUMBERS MORE THE OTHER WAY ROUND.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4KH1n-TTZY&ampt=286"">4:46</a> 1000000 Russians KIA for 1% of Ukrainian territory…These people are insufferable, all their takes on the conflict are absurd and utterly stupid"
These are C I A agents and not analysts. Shame on aljazeera.
Where did you get that clown reporting from Moscow?
Propaganda will not help naztzi Europe. This no media platform but a lying shir.
Stupid lying media bringing cia agents as analyst. Morons on media.
Once aljazeera stasttr partitioning Ukraine British lies about number of Russian soldiers dead i know that very soon they will be another ghost media known only fort stupidity.
Russian suffered 1m and Ukraine 400k. Thats why no one believed main stream media today. They just call numbers without thinking or someone gave you a paper to read from and ran with it
"Qatar is a lackey of the US, so AJ is spewing Western perspective, not Russian. The casualties are 1.5 million Ukrainians and Russia has 120k, the opposite of what AJ is reporting. Russia is fighting entire NATO, not just Ukraine. This war was triggered by the US, using Ukraine as a proxy, to weaken Russia then break it up like USSR, in order to steal its vast natural resources. The second objective of the war is to deprive China of an ally in subsequent war on the Chinese. The aim is to stop the nascent world order led by BRICS, thru Russia and China. Ukrainian oligarchs and elites are being paid for their service with billions in aid."
"Ukraine Was Begging For This. You Want It You Got It! And Thats Just The Beginning, The Worst Has Yet To Come!"
Aljazeera losing all credibility over this war. Because you are leaning towards Europe and Ukraine.
"NATO CHIEF once SAID IN 2023 that Russia was running out of weapons ,In 2025 Russia is STILL FIGHTING without any insufficiency of weapons ,ANOTHER E.U CLOWN said Russia is using chips from Dish washers, FROM refrigerators to make weapons"
"UKRAINE is losing land , military PERSONNELS, infrastructure etc"
This is a bad journalism unexpected from Aljazeera! What is the point of having a discussion between three anti-Russian/ pro-western/Ukrainian guys? Was it a debate or a friendly discussion?
As media Russia million Ukraine 100Do believe it?
Fallen Soldiers and families have to be deserving fully Respected
"If you are going to tell Ukraine where Russian troops are and where to aim, then it is not the Ukraine which is doing the job. The contradiction in this analysis is hilarious."
1000 in a day my goodness. Hows Russia able to sustain such looses.
Nice exercise in disinformation.
(PRO)WESTERN WAR MANIACS
"Uncritically stating western claims of casualty figures and using the western talking point that it’s “Russias full scale war on Ukraine.” I expect much better of Aljazeera. I’d like Ukraine to win the conflict too but 190,000 troops in 2022 is not a full scale invasion and to ignore the nuances and background of this war is irresponsible. Couldn’t watch past the 6 minute mark. This is propaganda."
When both sides tired and realized they made mistakes. Peace will prevail.
Liars fake analysis
"Why did aljazeera assembled only pro-Ukrainian panel, including the one they claimed was speaking from Moscow for this program?"
"Aljazeera propaganda here defy logic, over a million death Russian soldiers, how many soldiers do they have in in arms?"
"putin should stop his being EVIL, his EVIL AMBITION and his EVIL INVASION OF SOVEREIGN UKRAINE."
"As long as Zelensiky is a Ukraine leader and some European leaders has contributed to use Ukraine a bet to weaken Russia, WWIII is eminent, trust me."
"I think you owe us the number of casualties of Ukraine too, but you keep talking about the failures of the Russians while keeping silent about the other side."
"Man, dont ever critize any regime in ANY country, unless you already have experiences in managing and lead a country.Look into the mirror.One more thing.Doing research is better than reading news."
Russia is winning hands down despite what this FALSE NEWS channel is trying to portray
🇺🇦Ukraine is loosing everything
🇷🇺Russia is won against 50 fascist countries ...
"Question to European colonizers: If Russia is so losing in Ukraine, why are you so scared then?"
"Propaganda dont win a war. Lie all you want about casualties, the reality is telling the truth on ground. And today Ukraine is too embarrass to back 6000 bodies their soldiers because of the many lies they kept feeding about casualties."
ZV🇷🇺
That man is not a Russian he was paid to come on this news channel
"Peter Zalmayev better says what he says so that he is not dragged into military service by force. The Ukranians are always more one sided in their opinion than Russian guests. Doesnt look like a vivid democracy, certainly not a country that we should welcome to the EU."
"Russia also has a manpower shortage from a declining population, brain drain of young talented people, and insufficient workers. Aside from that its military equipment is severely depleated."
Thanks aljazeera
"painfull listening to your propaganda and by the way where do you get those figures from,?? Ukraine ofcourse.propaganda at worst"
"Russia a million Ukraine 4 hundreds, why why , but is not your fault is the work of the media propagandist devils vampires blood suckers western puppet, shame on you lier"
"For Zelensky, It does not matter even if all Ukranians be killed or all of Ukraine be destroyed. Zelensky is an Israeli agent and is working for the benefit of israel. Israels Gaza offensive is going on and Ukraines war will stop only after israels Gaza offensive is over. Its a well planned strategic step taken by israeli financers to keep diverting all muslim world attention, specially the caucasian muslim, who are the majority Russian soldiers fighting ukraine. Smart one will calculate and understand what I means."

"AJ is a BS news media, more fiction than facts. &quot1 million dead or wounded&quot this is totally BS"
Cant listen to that old man he is saying Russian gained 1% and losing a 1000 a day that Rubbish to put is on the nice way
Where is she getting the stats from Ukraine? Do you me Russia firing FABs and 10x with artillery. But has suffered a 600k more Ukraine

"I think Zelenski is afraid of the number of corpses, as he claims that roughly 30,000 soldiers have died during this time. But essentially, anyone who has followed both sides even a little knows that this number is far, far higher !"
Russia is so poor that it has never been feared.It has made the country even poorer without any end to the war. It is said that it will happenall the time of the war.
The war broke outLook at the Muslims coming inSo the war broke outStupid people show off their intelligence
Of course the Zelensky boys were wronged. They are just being always made to look bad. Poor them! Big bad Russian propaganda.
Poor Ukraine. They are a weak US puppet state lead by a corrupt cocaine addict whos not only beholden to the US war machine but Neo-Nazis in the shadows. Hopefully Russia can retake Ukraine fully and make it prosper under proper leadership.
"Expired Zelenskie not except receive bodys , this is terrible. Expired Zelenskie alredy say, he cant take bodys, because he need to pay each family big money for each died soldiers, its 6000 there. Expired Zelenskie just get angry Ukraine family members who waited long time receive loved one..."
Ukraine had to be shamed first
The rain is falling again...
"Ukrainian people didnt want or vote for war, forced into it by America &amp England....Nato France &amp Germany Zelensky a sheep being lead... To slow to pickup,its the orthodox Catholics targete, on both sides...this war is a cover...for them to achieve itRussia powerful nation, the loyalsit protestant new world order want it destroyed.."
"they are already resting in peace, but they still wont give them peace and dignity..."
"In the end Russia will prevail. And its not my opinion, but my understanding of a biblical prophecy. What we will see is the return of the king of the north - Russia, announced in Daniel 11:29a. Jesus also referred to this event:Matthew 24:6 reads: &quotThen you will certainly hear of battles and next the sounds of battles being fought (this indicates that the current war in Ukraine will escalate). Be careful not to be afraid (this in turn indicates that this war will spread to other countries, escalating to a very dangerous form (with the use of tactical nuclear weapons cf. Am 5:8,9) for everything must come to pass (meaning: to be fulfilled - Jesus here refers to Da <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGPuqknuN_s&ampt=689"">11:29</a>a) but the fulfillment (implicitly: of the sign) is not yet there–this means that the U.S will not get directly involved in this war, and the strategic nuclear weapon will not be used yet.)&quotAccording to Daniel 11:29a we will see Russia (depicted as the king of the north) RETURN. This means that Russia will again have military bases where it had in the previous century."
Nato created the Ukraine war.
Im curious as to how many American mercenaries are POWs in Russia?
They dont want to take 6k dead bodies nor their soldiers wounded or not. At list until this morning that was the case
They dont want to pay the families of the fallen solders the 300.000$ that the state promised. Thats why they wont take the bodies back.
"Sad that people die for dictators rich politicians ,war crimes against Ukraine Putin needs to be stopped know."
Ukraine did not turn up to collect their dead.
Ukraine doesnt want to take the bodies because they dont want to they dont have 6000 bodies of Russians
Shame to Zelesky and the West
"Notice how these are not conventional wars with ground troops, dog fights, hand to hand combat!?!?They take turns attacking each other! One side fires a bunch of missiles...then everything stops???? Half time!!! Now lets see what the other side is going to do! This is nothing more than getting rid of people... lowering the population count! Its all planned by the global leaders!"
"Well, since we all know that Ukraine and Russia pays of compensation for loved ones lost in this war, seems Ukraine is not in a rush to take those ones back to their relatives..."
"Ukraine: The living cannot leave, the dead cannot enter"
"A sleeping lion should never be provoked, Mr. Zelensky is repeatedly provoking Iron Man Mr. Putin, which is causing the entire Ukrainian people to suffer."
It seems Russia is winning this war. I am glad our president Trump is backing away from Ukraine.
Chapter: It is permissible to have with a captive &lt&lt Sahih Muslim 1456d &gt&gt
Chapter: Regarding Azl &lt&lt Sunan Abi Dawud 2172 &gt&gt

Ukraine doesnt really care about their dead.
Nuclear products?
"No more wars please, for the sake of children and mental health all over the world. Peace and diplomacy. Please"
Hmmm … Russian response was mystifyingly mild …
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,,"
Russia has rights to defend himself
Práve sa zobúdza rusky medveď

russia and Ukraine stop this nonsense
"Humans shields , Kh@mas hiding , blah blah"

Im tired of emboldened Mamas Boys...
"US plans to use Ukraine fight indirect with superpower, and force EU to pay similar payments of US from your taxpayers So who loss - EU taxpayers and Ukrainian residents suffer because have been brainwashed to fight for US with Russia ‼️"
Irán 🇮🇷 is not just attacking isra even attack Ukraine
Lied based information that is that Russia only used 400 drones. How come Ukraine claimed that they shot down 450 drones ?
American doing all Zionist propaganda over Middle East
Seems like russian bots also got a boost after the drone strike
"Follow the British, the people are more powerful than the hell itself."
Russian army was powerful army why Ukraine attacked them and why hit Air bases??
Russia is self defening....
"&quotMoscow says strikes are a response to terrorist act of bombing civilian train&quot. No need for quotation mark around the word terrorist as my clarification defines it as a terrorist act.There, I fixed it for you Al Jazerra. For a news organization, your grammar sure is bad."
"GNN (Gaza News Network) also known as Al-Jazeera is not focusing on humanitarian issues in Ukraine. To them, humanity is defined as Palestinians."
Free Ukraine
If this is the so called retaliation then Im embarrass just like the other Russian war blogger as this is no difference from what they have been doing before. They should expect more from kiev.
"This war tends to ww3 , because Britain organizing ww3 to Demolish development of other countries, conquer Europe and Christianity and Zelensky be their Kingsman helpings them to achieve their goals. Peace needed EUROPEANS were compelled by British greed to start WW3😮"
Kyiv always stop all the missles.
Poor response from Russia after such a big Ukrainian attack
Poor response from Russia after such a big Ukrainian attack
What goes around comes around
Terrorism will be punished
Russia is fighting not Ukraine alone but the whole Nato led by the US.
Russia is merciful unlike israel
Russia is terroeist
SHE IS LIVING LIKE NO WAR GOING ON LOL
BUT NAZIS LOVE DEATH
"NATO expansion threatening Russian National security is the root cause of the war. Folks who disagree should ask themselves, if US would allow a military alliance similar to NATO near US borders on the request of Cuba (remember Cuban missile crisis almost triggering WW3?) or Venezuela. NATO is not a country club you join to have a discount beer and a steak."
Ucronazis levando
Oct 7bis really bad idea
"Spider Web joy short lived. Now, No where to hide when Hellfire rains down."
Zelensky where is your backers now.
Get the Zionist midget out and STOP the WAR!!!
Russia is the terrorist! They bomb homes after invading a sovereign country!
"The news really have depicted all Russian attacks as miscalculated and less effective. Now feel sorry for Ukrainians coz everything in the news shows theyre doing fine, have few casualities etc"
Choices have consequences.
Who’s fault the killing of innocent Ukrainian citizens NATO and Zelinsky
"So Ukraine is like Palestine, then Russia is like Israel. If not please let some hypocrite differentiate it."
Evil Putin is killing everyone in Ukraine 🇺🇦
"Russia isnt responding strong enough, how long will it take until Russia responds in a major way?"
russia has shown itself to be much like the nazis they claim to have defeated.
"Ukraine should understand one thing, have any of the nations &quothelped&quot by America prospered? Just see Pakistan, Afganistan, Syria, Iraq. They push insurgents to attack nations that they feel are a threat to them and also push insurgents into nations and sneak into them under the pretext of saving them from the insurgent which they themselves pushed in. The drama is elaborate. Once you start receiving the &quotHelp&quot of US, its over for you for ever."
Zalensky is terrorist and anti national kick him out
"These attacks take weeks to plan, so I doubt this was in retaliation to Ukraines attack a few days ago."
"Foolishness, blood thirsty"
Shame on Putin
What is a good for!?
Russia is a losers absolute
I love how Youcrane hides Patriot systems within living districts
"Ukraine will never dare to attack Russia with bombers without American orders. What is the benefit of Russia balancing relations with America, Israel, and Europe? If Russia had strengthened Muslim countries with fighter jets and ballistic missiles, then which Muslim country would have stood by Russia, but Russia has realized too late who Russia's real enemy is.Russia has killed many Muslims in Afghanistan for many years. There is no country in the world that can be considered strong except Muslims. Muslims are brave, which can be understood by reading history."
Let them fight zelensky will know hes level in the end peace talks will be real and end the war
PutIer
"Ukraine attacked military targets, while Russia attacked civilians (apartment buildings, hospitals eth)"
Pathetic Russia attacking civilians
While we see many direct hits i think still Zelenesky is lying kkkkkk.
Coming to America soon
We want peace in Ukraine but America dont want it
"Mean all this time you have been making noise, Russia has just started being serious"
"ONLY INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE IN ANY WAR. SO, STOP ALL WARS IN THE WORLD."
WE NEED NO MORE WARS!STOP THE WAR EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD!
Weak response
Rubble coming soon..
Stop this power ragging war. Exercising of might and power is evil. I dnt want to hear of any country military superiority. I just want people to live in peace.
Again the Russians attacks civilians like a bunch of weak cowards
Uraaaaaaa
What did Ukraine expect
"So this is russias great retaliation? to strike a bunch of buildings. Also how is striking military targets terrorism? if this is the case then that would mean any country striking any military target is also terorism, and this is not going to help their army on the ground which has not taken over more land since ukraine retook land north of kiev and karkhiv that russia initially took over."
This is why Russia is losing this war. The Ukrainians strike military targets that hurts the Russians bad! The Russians attack bunch of women and children sleeping in their beds!
Bravo 🇷🇺 Russia
Did they not expect retaliation?
Russian Federation
&quotTo stop him now or to stop him later?&quot That is the question!
Thanks aljazeera
"If this is all they could do as responses, Russia has nothing else under the sleeves"
Blame Zelensky..
So Ukraine hit bases and planes and bridges Russia hits civilians in KievWho is the real terrorist? Platypus looks unhinged
Zelensky must step down!! Stop the conflict and make peace
So Ukraine hit bases and planes and bridges Russia hits civilians in KievWho is the real terrorist? Platypus looks unhinged

Zelensky nato puppet this man just had to say no to nato side wit Russia no war
Attention: Massive russofascists intrusion.
"If russofascists killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than zionazis killed Palestinian children, does that make russia four times less fascist than israel?"
"When Ukraine strike the west says awesome, when Russia respond they cry Oh its terrifying."
Zelensky the president of peace
Hahaha Everyone is criminal in this world Everyone is terrorist
I was expecting a huge strike on military assets or something.But not just this? This is pathetic
Only neutral status and federative status of Ukraine will satisfy Russia ( if Odessa and other mostly Russian speakers cities will be within Ukraine borders).
"Sungguh bodoh sekali rakyat ukraina kenapa tidak segera ganti presiden badut, zelensky itu sumber masalah untuk rakyat ukraina...bodoh sekali kalian."
"The joker should resign without putting the innocent people in danger. He has no idea what he is doing, too much ego creating disaster. Thank god that this was not nuclear or anything else yet."
Yes of course. &quotDebris&quot from the intercepted missiles. Definitely looks like a fallen missile or rock did that damage.
"&quotI havent seen Hitler,but I see Nazis.I havent witnessed the Holocaust,but I see people dying every moment.Im not afraid of animals,Im terrified of humans.&quot"
Vladimir Putin sir please reconsider your goal.. Many of your men including Ukraine men are dying for this war... Nobody wants war im an Asian please have a talk with a Democratic nation and settle this once and for all! Its the best decisive moment any nations can make. Please come into terms.... For the world to be a safer place to live.. From a construction worker from the Philippines 🙇‍♂️
Operation Tarantulas of Russia in retaliation against Operation Spider web of Ukr.
"Ukraine shoots down drones and missiles, violating the target. Missiles flying only at military targets. In this way, it kills its own citizens. Innocent people. Ukraine places air defense in residential areas, hiding behind peaceful citizens."
"One attack destroys an airbase, the other targets residential areas in a big capital and calls out a terror attack."
USA dan NATO harus bertanggung jawab atas semua kekacauan di seluruh penjuru dunia
"as an afghan i can sympathize with the civilian victims of the war between these two imperialist ,superpowers they also blown my country to pieces and an irresponsible leader like zelensky are usually the main cause of such catastrophies free Ukrain and free palestine"
"No matter what, the Russians still show humanity at a level we are not used to seeing even during war,The West and the US had no consideration at all for civilians even if they did nothing to them, in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan,but the Russians have the ability to wipe out any city with one bomb but they dont do it."
Why are your only one country. Because of this fake propaganda.
"Still Ukraine targets military targets, while Russia targets civillian areas.Shame on Putin"
"Una guerra proxi de Ucrania que nunca se habría iniciado si la CIA yanqui y el MI6 británico no hubieran provocado el golpe de Estado del Euromaidan en Kiev en 2014. Además esas dos agencias anglosajonas financiaron y armaron a las organizaciones nazis ucranianas. De ahí a la guerra civil del Donbass y luego a la invasión rusa del 2022, hecha para proteger a las repúblicas del Donbass y sobre todo para la propia SEGURIDAD ESTRATÉGICA de la Federación Rusa. NO FUTURE WITH WARS. 🌎💰💰💰💀💀💀🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Ukraine attack Military site.... Russia attack Civilians area
"Chapter: The killing of Kab bin Al-Ashraf Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: A critic of the prophet of Islam, Ka’b bin Al-Ashraf, had mocked him in verse. Muhammad asked his followers: “Who is willing to kill Ka’b bin Al-Ashraf who has hurt Allah and His Apostle?” One of the , Muhammad bin Maslama answered, “O Allah’s Apostle! Would you like that I kill him?” When Muhammad said that he would, Muhammad bin Maslama said, “Then allow me to say a (false) thing (i.e. to deceive Kab).” Muhammad responded: “You may say it.” &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 4037 &gt&gt"
Isreali sahoni dajjali terrorist natunyaho terrorist America terrorist Free philistines
Ukraine should have never given up their nuclear arsenal.
Drone have make russian look lil powerless..
Ukraine asked for it
cant stand that reporter....aha ah ah um er ah um h ah
Not powerful enough.
Good shots rasiya
"Putin kills Ukrainian civilians, but Ukraine is attacking military bases."
Dont mess with super power
Drones war ...without Flag ....Ukraine Usa drones Under Ukraine Flag ....
Why Ukraine didnt stop complaining
"No more wars, please."
"This Russian special military operation has only exposed Russias military weakness,Given NATO 2 new members, Encourage Europe to rearm,and made other nations less dependent on Russian Gas"
Our prayers are with you to stop. This wars
poor peaceful russia
Keep it up aljazeera journalists we all support you and the dignity of reporting
Our prayers Russia revenge not reaching Gaza situation oh God those two wars should stop in peace
"Putin is insane to make such comment, Ukraine is just defending itself and Russia under his leadership is the aggressor. How can Ukraine choose between peace and war?"
Putler taking like he wants peace not Ukraine
"And again Putler creats excuses to keep up his war trough saying Ukraine is sabotage his country, what a weak KGB excuse 🫡"
"The attacks on bridges and railway lines in stolen Ukrainian Crimea are &quotacts of terrorism&quot while the targeting of schools, hospitals and residential blocks in Ukraine, rape and mutilation of civilians by Russian troops, are WHAT EXACTLY?"
This Zelensky guy will cry.
"The Ukrainian Joker Zelensky is not interested and serious on the ceasefire and he is not working for the Ukrainian state but as a pimp of British and CIA.The time of the attack when there was a possiblity of leadership level talks the idiot destroyed it by crossing the Russian Nuclear redline, Zelensky is the Ukrainian version the Israeli Motherfuc*er Netanyahu."
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 Stop the War ...Human rights organizations are dead ??
Russia is a joke
And Keiv still stands
A comedian belongs in the theatre im always astonished how a comedian is allowed to manage a whole nation..... is like mixing water with oil... may Allah have mercy on Zelensky and it influences
"Putin have some nerves talking about peace, does he wants peace he only wants to grab more lands just like his predecessors in ancient Russia"
Ukraine targeting military targets not civilians like Russians they target civilians thats the difference
Ukraine targeting military targets not civilians like Russians they target civilians
You invaded a country and clamour for peace.What a foolish man Putin is
Zelenskyy attack Russia and suddenly rattles about peace
Even before this putin didnt accept any kind of ceasefire proposal
Who cares and does Africa benefit from old dictators who want to steal land
Putin seems angry. I wonder why.
Ukraine don’t want peace
Russia are cooking something.... Be ware Ukraine
the next ceasefire and zelensky will start retaliate
"Ukraine will soon understand that the war is about to start, no ceasefire. Go motherRussia"
"Whatever NATO will do for ukraine is useless, madness, hypocrisy and delusional because they are blind and deaf on real atrocities and genocide in Gazza"
Go Russia go
if crybaby putin wanted peace he would tell his guys to pack up and go home. the more he fights the more weapons U.S and NATO give to ukraine
"If “attempted attacks” causes that much damage, I wonder what a real attack would cause"
"O believers! Do not ask about any matter which, if made clear to you, may disturb you. &lt&lt Quran 5:101 &gt&gt"
"Chapter: Asking too many questions ,The Prophet said, &quotThe most sinful person among the is the one who asked about something which had not been prohibited, but was prohibited because of his asking.&quot &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 7289 &gt&gt"
NATO shouldnt be worried about Ukraine because NATO is already blind deaf and dumb on GAZA ..SO WHAT IS HURRY when it comes about Ukraine ???
"If russofascists killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than judeozionazis killed Palestinian children, does that mean that russia is four times less fascist than israel?.."
"Slava russia we all respect putins decisions for taking back what belonged to the soviet union back in history.....with love from nairobi,kenya"
"russia has the rights to defend it self, its russia turn"
Zelensky wants to prolong war to prolong his presidency. Power is addictive when you are being flattered by EU leaders and western elites.
The looser dictator
Zelesky is a puppet of Nato and Destroying own country for proxy war between Russia and Nato.
"More like, NATO doesnt want peace."
There was a time when the world feared Russia. Today the world laughs about Russia. What a pathetic country.
Infrastruckture meant to supply arms!
Mother Russia
Al Jazeera is one of the best news channels in the world. It is worth watching and has made western propaganda news channels lagged behind
At present enemies of democracy USA United States &amp Ukraine political forces had Russia can easy access distroyby NATO nations such as someone moment is Very high dangerous crisis movement political forces by artificial fallows to this event. Russia can example political forces explain thats like the whole world democracy can ruling only one nation political command the soveat Union. 🚷☸️✝️🇺🇸🇮🇱⚔️🔥🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
Utter n*nsense….these news outlet as well the guests
"The Ukrainian Joker Zelensky is not interested and serious on the ceasefire and he is not working for the Ukrainian state but as a pimp of British and CIA.The time of the attack when there was a possiblity of leadership level talks the idiot destroyed it by crossing the Russian Nuclear redline, Zelensky is the Ukrainian version the Israeli Motherfuc*er Netanyahu."
Theyre trying to provoke the bear to do something foolish but the bear its not a stupid bear it has no need to go nuclear it is already demonstrated it has alien technology because the hypersonic test without a nuclear payload was looking like an alien spaceship firing on Earth is enough to scare the bejesus out of anyone how easily they forget
Terrorist Ukraine .
&quotNow its my turn&quot - Putin
"NATO VS RUSSIA , LETS NOT LIE"
Russia vs US
Putin is not serious
"Ukraine has no contingency plan for what is coming, people better leave cities like Kyev because this will be the worst retaliation since the beginning of this war where many victims including deaths will occur"
That was fast.
"Not Pearl Harbor, but more so the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. A daring long range attack that stunned the people of Japan."
That bridge was reopen 3 hours after the blast
Thanks aljazeera
"This is a statement from Ukraine, showing creativity in its attacks on Russias resources which are enabling Putin invasion of Ukraine. Even if we wish the damage was worse, this is showing Putin and its citizens that Russia IS at war and they won’t go untouched. The only difference is, Ukraine attacks military targets, Russia attacks innocent citizens. Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦"
"YouTube, EZEKIEL 38 wars.Countries destroyed for opposing the Palestine occupation Somalia Sudan Libya Yemen Afghanistan Iraq Syria Lebanon Palestine Russia Rohingya Uighur Kashmir Kosovan Iran. War killed millions of innocent people and caused millions of jobless and homeless in America and Europe."
No damage but proved a point. Russia is not out of touch.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺...
"“Ukraine wants a ceasefire” by attacking the planes, standing in the open according to the nuclear treaty with the USA, their ally and supplier? Are you a pro-Ukrainian media outlet? Don’t you know the consequences of breaking nuclear treaties for the world? Are you advocating nuclear WWIII?"
That bridge could collapse at any time.
Russia says NOTHING. NOTHING BUT BULLSHIT
Bullshit! Russian propoganda. Slava Ukraine!
"Stop narrating Ukraine versus Russia, it is NATO versus Russia"
Congratulations to the Ukrainians.
Alah died in an airstrike in khan younis last evening
Cremeria is Ukraine custody
"So what do Russians call it attacks on Ukraine, love taps. What wrong with these people."
So basically that was all for nothing
The engineers who built this bridge should build my next relationship.
in russia bridge need no pillar
"Wait, I though this bridge was the best guarded and protected piece of infrastructure in the world. Not even a fly would be able to come close to it. What happened, Kremlin? Where are your ultra-competent intelligence services?"
"That was only western propaganda media, reality hit miner one"
"☪ Then he said, Where is the little one? Call the little one to me. Hasan came running and jumped into his lap. Then he put his hand in his beard. Then the Prophet opened his mouth and put his mouth in his mouth.&quot &lt&lt Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 1183 &gt&gt 🌙"
Why is Al Jazeera running a 2-year+ old footage of the truck bombing attack on this bridge?
"Allahs Messenger said, &quotIf anyone of you goes to an open space for answering the call of nature he should neither face nor turn his back towards the Qibla he should either face the east or the west.&quot &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 144 &gt&gt"
Putin went to hide in the deepest Bunker in Kreml.
"Allahs Messenger said, &quotWhile I was at Makkah, the roof of my house was opened and Jibril descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zamzam water. &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 3342 &gt&gt"
Who dares crossing this bridge?
Zelensky will never Learn
Crimea belongs to ukraine russia is illegally occupying crimea...and its illegal invasion of ukraine illegal under international laws and u.n charter..russia must be kick out of u n for its action on crimea ukraine..
Why not Ceasefire for Palestine 🇵🇸 ???
Russia 🇷🇺 🪆 and Ukraine 🇺🇦 direct talks in Turkey 🇹🇷
Ukraine 🇺🇦
Russia 🇷🇺 🪆 and Ukraine 🇺🇦 direct talks in Turkey 🇹🇷
Russia Ukraine
Russia should swallow its pride theres no way Ukraine should withdraw from areas they have never captured instead they should withdraw from Ukrainian territories they have failed to complete capture
Russia doesnt negotiate with terrorists. The status quo remains the same.
"Can you imagine, satanic demands. How can you dictate, the numbers of people enlisted in a sovereign nation Army. This is ridiculous. Is like Kremlin officials reason with their foot and not brains. They must pull out troup from where you are not able to capture militarily. Am laughing in my language"
"quotO you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger &lt&lt Quran 4:59 &gt&gt"
Russia is being too nice. If it was the us army Ukraine would have been a waste land already
"Russias demands are ridiculous, Jesus."
Russia: &quotTrust me bro.&quotUkraine: &quotNo.&quot
Justice for Sana Yousuf ?
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,,,,"
"No ukrainian, NATO involve attack on bridge"
Putin playing with this FOOL for far too long now he started to look weak..what is he doing ??? Hes LETTING this fool playing him like fool...
Now i am beginning to doubt about Russia capability
If you overdo it then you are not aiming for peace but war
Zelenskys aim should be peace and not war
"Ukraine just wants to lose more land above this area, so russia doesnt just have one access bridge"
How is russia a super power?
More and more leaders are crazy and eager for violence and war. Idiots who dont know how precious life is and that they throw this gift away. Every nation has the leaders they deserve. Enjoy the idiots you elect.
"No idea what zelensky is trying to prove that he is idiot. Well, we all know that. Russia will take out all ukrainian infrastructure. Parasite zelensky does not care about own people."
Cars have started going over bridge .
The Ukrainians people are held hostage by their non Ukrainians leaders. A third of Ukraine has fled to Russia. 3 million in Poland. Milions in surrounding countries. Ukraine only has 25% of thier population left. They are hostages to a terrorist regime like the people in Gaza.
These deep sea divers obviously got an agenda
Putin would have accepted Ukraine to be neutral. He told the West for years no to NATO for Ukraine. Put the same scenario to the US and potentially hostile states surrounding that nation. The US wouldnt accept it.
Ukraine is boxing above its weight with encouragement from some countries.
Poke the Bear and find out.
"Russia doesn’t use the Crimea bridge for military or civilian supplies since the last bridge bombing attack by Ukraine. All the military supplies are now shipped via the occupied land by train. So, the bridge attack doesn’t have any military significance - only political."
"More bad news for AJ. They can’t catch a break between Russia, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza"
What is putin waiting for. Putin is coward now
"It’s all over for Ukraine, Russia has been going on lightly on civilians and infrastructure unlike Israel."
Utube is just another establishment backing MSM platform
I never thought a few years back that aljazeera would turn into propagandist channel.
"Trump/Vance : Zelenskyy, you have no card Putin/Xi : Trump/Vance, you have no card too"
"he image is not a bridge. It could be anything, except a bridge. Fake Comedian!"
NATO really going for it !!!
Russia has more nukes than US. They are ranked num 1. Ukraine be playing with fire I think they dont know
INDIAN AND RUSSIAN BOTS ARE THE SAME AS TERROIRST GROUPS
Ukraine is a terrorist state
"Zelensky is the destroyer of Ukraine, after 3 years what has he gained, lost 20% of land, thousands of people died, the country is devastated......."
"London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down, falling down. My fair lady !"
Go on ...keep provoking the Bear
Russia have you see u are playing a hide and seek game with Ukraine now have you seen the damage NATO have cost u
Report: 2 baby fish were killed.
"Putin never forget and forgive his enemies , now wait and see the Retaliation"
Im beginning to suspect that the Super Freinds under Aquaman supervision is responsible for this!? And Im certain the Wonder Twins and a primate were involved...
"russia is just pathetic, it cannot even defend itself from anything anymore"
&quot...one thousand explosives..&quot ???Wrong.
What a beautiful host
Russian should just allow Ukraine be
Tonight Kiev do not sleep...
Only cowards murder innocent civilians.
Thanks aljazeera
Free Free Crimea!
Zelensky has suicidal thoughts after this.
Useless Aljazeera…. It’s called a terrorist attack….
You can say for sure Armageddon about to begin in a matter of days .
Peace talks in Turkey are not working
3 TU 95 Bombers1 TU 22 bomber1 TU 90S destroyed.Hardly significant
"A wise man says that Muslims are considered Punchers, which according to him is not a good thing, then what is this, it is a thousand times better than this work."
"I’ve always stood up for the truth and justice and in this war it’s Putin the one who is in the right. But BUT after seeing for years that he doesn’t do F all in retaliation except eating cabbage, I’m now fed up and congratulate Zelensky and the CIA for the provocative attacks."
Why is everyone cheering? This is not mean peace. This means more war
Russia engineers are amazing. The bridge withstand that impact should be studied
Zelensky is intimidating he want to make cous this man is danger or he is control by NATO
Human rights organisation nonsense must stay out of whats coming
From Comedian to Strategist this is M Zelenskyy
"Russian bridge 3, Ukraine 0"
But Tonald Drump promised there would be peace within 24 hours before he would become president he would solve Russia and Ukraine war what happened Drumpf?
Turns out he had the cards while the one who said he did not have them is not playing with a full deck.
The Ukrainians want to prove with these US actions that the war is not lost yet and give us weapons and money and we will still win! I wonder how much longer the West will throw money down the drain!
"Not a thousand explosives, over a thousand kilograms of explosives."
Ukraine 🇺🇦 should wait for response and its not Ukraine 🇺🇦 BUT WEST....
"RUSSIA CAN TRANSPORT GOODS BY LAND, SO WHATS THE SENSE OF DESTROYING THE BRIDGE IF THE GOODS WILL BE DELIVERED ANYWAY?"
Kiev and Amarica are really trying to get Putin to respond with oreshnic missiles. Then they can say look at Russia escalating. Lol
well lasors are the way to go for istance to launch a missle costs thousands to fire a lasor costs a few dollars its obvious. also ukraine can knock out nucliar missles with them.
Why not show after the explosion? no damage done?
Ukraine is winning
"At this point we can all agree that Russia is a joke. Surviving only on propaganda, solely relying on its nukes, scaring and bullying people with atomic devastation. No other nuclear capable country even mention an attack with nuclear weapons."
Theyre trying to distract Russian troops because theyre close but they soon feel the wrath of the
Really Putin is going to use nuclear weapons ? Very very bad news. We have no dare to see more innocent people dying after watching gaza
"The Russian paper tiger is a joke, they are destined to fail!"
They do stupid things but they didnt know what will happen next.
"Putin is playing with Ukraine. As I said before, he is playing with Zelensky and Zelensky may be the one to kill him."
This is bad news. War will expend
Putin should stop massaging Zelensky
"Let them enjoy their short term victory. But please, dnt start talk crying victim when they are hit hard. Because there is no need for this level of recklessness that cant lead to peace"
Confused whether watching Aljazira or BBC !
Ukraine is digging his own grave
Russia does not use that bridge for arms supply anymore. Its purely civilian use now.They supply via land now... look at a map.
What is with these pro Russian comments?
&quotNo cards! No cards!!&quot- Trump&ampVance
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦🇵🇭
"Clearly, Zelensky doesnt want this war to end, otherwise why will he keep provoking Putin while talks are ongoing."
NATO playing with fire. You will crying foul soon. Russians are good in this game!
Poor Ukraine people will suffer for this.... So sad
"Al jazeera, have you ever seen Russian reporters being happy about killings in Gaza?"
A civilian bridge.The Army do not use it. Typical Al Jazeera nonsense. They still cant get over the fact that Russia played a vital role in Syria.
Nice try tho
Trump cant dare accuse Ukraine of these strikes but as soon as Russia retaliate he
"Its not Ukraine, these actions are being done by US, UK, France and Germany. It is to derail the capture of most of the Ukraine."
If this is true these guys are extremely extremely impressive. That bridge would have been closely monitored.
In Sha Allah Russia 🇷🇺 Will Be Victorious
Putains strategic patience seems more like hoping that he will be hanging out with the western partners he secretly would like to buddy up with
America and European countries have strengthened Ukraine to attack Russia 🇷🇺 because they all think that Russia is a big threat to their country
"Wasnt that bridge NO LONGER used by the Russian military to serve military logistics? Theyve already moved to land-based roads and railways, and the bridge now only serves civilian traffic."
The wait for the response
"Trump asked him if he had a card, and he did drone suicide."
Russia hyperfans from indonesia:
"This is not Ukraine, but Europe and the US, who are fighting with Russia. But Russia is very soon reciprocating to this attack."
Maranatha.
Mad men should not have long-range airframes anyways!
"Nato forces out of mind, they pressing WWAR"
Saying patriot can shoot down Oreshnik is like saying Biden can run up the stairs without stumbling.
Bullies only understand strength. Operation Web!
"This all basically, good luck Peace in Turkey. Many sides clearly not interested in peace now."
Russia being very patient
"When youve lost the conflict and theres nothing more to do, you resort to terrorism. Whatever your propaganda, Zelensky will finally sign the capitulation deal. The Russians only focus on the final outcome."
Ukraine is on suicide mission .
"Russia is not Middle East Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya, war with Russia big mistake."
"Crazy, ukraine has forces deep deep inside russia."
i fail to understand why peace talk in going on in instanbul yet ukraine is busy bombarding russia
"Aljazeera talked like Ukraine mouth,aljazeera Nato fake news ,shame on u Qatar 🇶🇦"
Again and again and again provocation continues..... Dont believe a ju.....zelenskey is a ju
Attention: massive intrusion by russofascists.
with this Pace Ukraine will take over Russia soon. what a turn around
Ukraine is playing with fire.
"Thats ok, if at first you dont succeed..."
White terrorists that the world will not say

Rumour has it that Putin is hiding just like Allah after the pager attack
"President Trump is correct. Unnecessary War It s not about Russia invading. It is about AZOV ethnically cleansing Ukrainians for speaking a different dialect of their common Russian language. Unnecessary War Merkel worked out a solution for peace, but Johnson and Biden bribed the little man to continue to push for war. I hope Putin have the courage to avail himself of the opportunity for peace offered by the President. This is an unnecessary War. May God never forgive those that pushed the world to the brink of a nuclear war. Namely: Johnson and Sunak, Scholtz, Biden, Starmer, Merz, Blinken and Macron."
"Damage- driving cars over a damaged bridge is not the same as a train, which this bridge does have"
Do they not know that Russia can wipe out nearly every bridge in Ukraine in a 24 hour period or less..Targeting bridges with civilian traffic is terrorism.
Russia has whole Land bridge to supply its forces
"Ukraine can’t win this war without the U.S., and Russia’s response will be violent."
"Not &quot more than 1000 explosives&quot, 1100kg of explosives"
Zelensky..has a death wish
"Know Islam, No peace No Islam, know peace"
"Now USA and the world knows that Ukraine has ” more Cards” than they thought. Keep defending yourself, Viva Ukraine 🇺🇦"
I think Ukraine doesnt want to live anymore
Primero
Zelensky poured cold water on any swapping of dead personnel.
Shame on America
Ukraine is western backed why is Russia still holding back this much... They could have destroyed Ukraine if it was the west eg usa they would use nukes by now.. Am sure..
"6000 to 6000 dead solders, how can that be, Ukraine 🇺🇦 doesnt have that many Russian dead soldiers, Russia is going to get hundreds dead while Ukraine is going to get 6000 dead soldiers"
So many young men dying for politicians.
Thanks aljazeera
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE THE SOLDIERS OF ISRAEL TAKE A VACATION IN YOUR COUNTRY... DO YOU ACCEPT THEM... THEY KILLED HUNDRED OF CHILDREN AND ROB THEIR LAND
Never trust russofascists and judeozionazis.
6000 dead imagine how many people died for what! They gave them lives for Some fools
"But someone has to make Russia get serious on peace, this movement of back and forth exchange of prisoners is not a success bse theyve always exchanged prisoners theres nothing like success in this negotiations Turkey should stop confusing us"
Turkish ardogan and the whole country is not a fit and just place to do any peace making agreement...
Who are those Russian military specialists? Maybe its time to publish their names!
6000 to 6000 so that is 12000 lives wasted just in that comment. So sad
Kamakaze!!!
I was surprised that Ukraine was able to launch such a high quality operation.
Brilliantly done by Ukraine.
Russia should cut their losses and just end the war.
"The message to Russia &amp the US is youre vulnerable. Planes, infrastructure, politicians, &amp more are sitting ducks"
Oreshniks inbound
No Sanction on EU/ US allies Israel Witnessing Genocide in real time..
I liked the articulation of India’s stance. Thank you.
Those planes are like 70 years old ... lol the youngest of them maybe 30 ... I dont think its a big deal .. they would not have used those planes for nuclear strikes ...
Zelensky and Ukrainians love war and Sanctions.Let them continue to enjoy fighting Russia. USA must focus on growing their economy.
God bless Ukraine 🇺🇦
Masha la. Ukraine is best. Bismi la
Putin is so bitter since he likes destroying lives and properties other countries and not his. A time will come and is here when Russia will accept and say to people there is a living God in heaven and he oversee everything on earth
No country can be arrogant enough on this earth like Russia killing people and their properties as if they are the creators of the earth and thereof. One time not far Russia will come to understanding that God is supreme
Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Zeleniski will DESTROY Ukraine. He does not care about the country. Just his position which will be terrible once the war actuallyStops. Is there a coincidence such an attack came days before the ceasefire talks?Only fools get played and majority of the masses are fools. This comment section a prime example how people are easy to be played with.
I wonder if the US has helped Ukraine.
Forget China. Russia is well on track to becoming North Koreas junior partner
Russia should not accept any peace negotiation going forward.
Putin is delusional. Why would Ukraine agree to surrender when he is losing?
I like it when western media fools everyone by promoting the narrative they have been paid for.
Yang wenli like tactic
Russia occupy less area after three years of war than in the beginning of the invasion. They lack the capability to defeat Ukraine. There is no &quotescalation&quot from russia. They have been doing their worst for 3 years.
Russia will soon realize that being a superpower isnt by invading a small Ukraine. Ukraine is gradually making Russia weak before Europe. Germany has to find its purpose and make Europe safe.
"With this singular attack by Ukraine, Putin should negotiate. And do it now. He does not know what the clown/jester (Zelensky) has planned for him ..."
I can not imagine how angry Putin is right now.
And the world turned upside down- Hamilton the battle of Yorktown
Its impossible for the USA not to know that was going to happen. What were Two Doll Donnies threats to Russia about?
"Trumps! sanction/tariff did not work against Russia,, only bombs work... it is war not economy?"
The lobbied paid war monger countries and its paid battlefield states versus independent sovereign countries. Lets see.
Its like something right out of Ace Combat. May Ukraine prevail!
"Ukraine has cards, everyone aare dealt cards. Going all-in with pocket deuces and hoping nobody calls is a gamble. Now they have to wait and see what response they get. Its the waiting that really tortures. 9/11 and Oct 7 attacks didnt benefit the attackers in the longer run."
Not a religious person but David and Goliath is a great metaphor here is a great metaphor. Russia has always been a lumbering oaf.
Was it confirmed that the drones were AI-trained? I’ve heard conflicting reports.
The blatant violation of the START Treaty with the terrorist attacks on Russian strategic nuclear bomber bases? The &quotmessage&quot is that the US is a UK colony and should no longer be negotiated with.
Zelensky and Netenyahu are two Jews from eastern Europe are bringing about the end of humanity as we currently know it.
Zelensky is trying to start world war three.
Not good for peace talk for the war
Moral of the story never trust in USA.
"Essa pegou todo mundo de surpresa. &quotTeia de Aranha&quot pode não mudar o rumo da guerra, mas deixa Putin e seu aliado Trump com algumas dúvidas: se os ucranianos fizeram uma vez, podem fazer de novo? E em que escala?"
"Russias red lines mean nothing. Oh no, nuclear saber rattling again.."
"First at the start. Why would anyone care what America thinks, it is at best neutral and more like a bad actor in the Ukraine war now. Guess we have to keep the Yanks from whining or they will withdrawal all support."
Lady why r u shuting
The only message is that they want another Oreshnik.
"As much as the attacks where brilliant, i am so afraid of the reciprocal reactions."
India supports Russias war machine
",,,4000km!! Russia shoujd be afraid, it doesnt matter even if it was launched from inside Russia what is evident is it has NO capability to monitor the vast Russian terittory, So are the Yankies as was demononstrated by “ chinese weather ballon”"
What message? Desperation?
"Zelenzky have criminal Jewish back up,"
"Because of this war European is hard may people are at home , Los their jobs energy and food costs a lot in European. We need peace"
They did good job that didnt consult with trump.He could have stopped or leaked information.
"As the Baltic sea was brought up @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFPQArxbZcs&ampt=720"">12:00</a>, it needs to be noted that it was Putins illegal invasion of Ukraine that pushed both Sweden and Finland to join NATO, thus increasing NATOs coastline of the sea over 20 fold, a real &quotoops&quot move by Russia."
"Arrest Zelensky and bring him back to reality, stop clowning around"
So many rounds of sanctions on Russia but none on Israel no wonder Russia is dismissive of the double standards West.
Zelenzky has the cards.
"Western World only consists about 15~20 % of world population, and the pure White Skins are about t become minority of their own native countries. Yet, they love to killed themselves at wars, amid the low birth rate.Besides the war, they are addicted to alcohols, drugs, gun violence, married out of their race and LBGTQ. In next 20 years, Pure Whites will be less than 10~15% of world population. Looking forward to Indian decented PM and Presidents of all English Speaking countries, and UK already had one as an example."
"How many times Zelensky celebrated, and then cry after"
If this was planned for over a year then there is no turning back. Past year of talks has been a lie. These white nations have not been civilized so consequently they still acting up and testing weapons on each other as they continue to destroy OLD WORLD ARCHITECTURE
"It was necessary to give a lesson to Russia that not only them are capable for escalation, for negotiations, in case of necessity&quot ...wow , please slowdown Hanna. Lol"
Psy Op….they are the same people. No one is naive to believe there isn’t a bigger play.
What a PR STUNT BY KYIV REGIME...as always..this wont change the course of the smo..Moscow will achieve all its objectives..this regime never learns at all
Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab: The Prophet said: A man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife. &lt&lt Sunan Abi Dawud 2147 &gt&gt
"☪ Chapter: The Rights Of A Woman Upon Her Husband It was reported from Hakim bin Muawiyah that he asked: &quotO Messenger of Allah! What are the rights that our wives have over us? He replied: &quotThat you feed her when you eat, and clothe her when you wear clothes, and that you avoid hitting her in the face 👊 &lt&lt Sunan Abu Dawud 2142 &gt&gt 💪"
Summer is prime war fighting season
"Ukraine destroyed 50% of Russian Blacks Sea fleet, without having any fleet on their own. 30% of strategic air force without having strategic air force on their own. They are not clowns they’re magicians!"
It send the message: &quotkill us&quot
The Jew just loves shedding more Christian blood
That litle guy messed up
Zelensky wants to get rid of more Ukrainians by doing this.
Lots of Americans believe Russian propaganda
The clown wants unconditional ceasefire without Russian retaliation? Very smart clown.
Fake planes.
Says nothing
What happened after pearl harbor? Thats whats going to happen to Ukraine now.
Goncharenko is a total GRIFTER
"These guy is an absolute clown . This war is three years plus old and sanctions only made Russia retool its economy, some new sanctions will not do anything."
"Russia already has 16k different sanctions and it hasnt slowed, much less stopped. Sanctions only sound good in the publics ear."
Better question is how do we stop US and Britain with E.U. Following right along…….
You have no points to upload
Ukraine is winning and still Ukraine losing land and manpower
"America has lost interest , the focus has moved on ."
Best News! Really appreciate the Russians inspite of drone attack!!
Why do we only hear the Ukrainian side of the story and not the Russian side?
Good. Russa....
Exchange Putin for all Russian prisoners
I dont know how Russia can agree to a ceasefire since the rare earth deal between Ukraine and the U.S.
"attacking Russia during peace talk and they say they want to end the war, thats never going to happen even a kid can see that"
The word deported is misused in context.
Seems Putin has been hurt by yesterdays strikes... Their power comes from the perception of their power... Power is reduced now
Please live up to promise in ASAP including the the hand over of Iraq and Syria unconditionally. What do you think is political settlement become promulgated peacefully any time in the future!!
It is time for the European Colonialist Zio’s (ECZ) also to stop occupation of Palestine.
"respect Russia, no war crimes, unlike Israel"
When will the European Colonialist Zio’s stop the Palestine genocide?
"☪ Abu Sirma berkata kepada Abu Said al Khudri: &quotWahai Abu Said, adakah kamu mendengar utusan Allah menyebut tentang al-azl (coitus interruptus)?&quot Dia berkata, &quotYa&quot, dan menambah: &quotKami keluar bersama utusan Allah dalam ekspedisi ke Mustaliq dan menawan beberapa wanita Arab yang unggul dan kami menghendaki mereka kerana kami menderita ketiadaan isteri kami, (tetapi pada masa yang sama) kami juga menghendaki tebusan untuk mereka. Maka kami memutuskan untuk mempunyai 👉👌 dengan mereka tetapi dengan memerhatikan azl&quot (menanggalkan hubungan seksual sebelum keluar dari kandungan lelaki). Tetapi kami berkata: &quotKami melakukan suatu perbuatan sedangkan Rasul Allah ada di antara kami, mengapa tidak bertanya kepadanya?&quot Maka kami bertanya kepada utusan Allah dan beliau berkata: &quotTidak mengapa jika kamu tidak melakukannya, kerana setiap jiwa yang dilahirkan hingga hari kiamat akan dilahirkan&quot &lt&lt Sahih Muslim 1438a &gt&gt 🌙"
"It was narrated from Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri that during the war ⚔ with the Bani Al-Mustaliq they (Muslims) captured some women, and intended to have intercourse with them without impregnating them. So they asked the Prophet about intercourse interruptus. The Prophet said, &quotIt is better that you do not do it, for Allah has written whom He will create until the Day of Resurrection&quot. &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 7409 &gt&gt"
Zelensky spreads propaganda as he speaks.
That’s why I don’t trust Putin &amp Trump.
Russia should direct deal with countries supplying weapons and money… making Ukraine as proxy …..
This war wouldve been over from 3 years ago if Boris the clown didnt stop Zelensky.
Attacks were made by the NATO not the Ukraine. It is the first sign that NATO fully attacking Russia under the flag of Ukraine!!
Ukraine must not provoke a NUCLEAR ATTACK on its territory!!!! Russia has a right to self defense against any EXISTENTIAL THREATS
"A Brief Look at Operation “Ukrainian Spider Web” : Analysis by Dr. Vladimir Brovkin Zelensky Attacks Russian Air Base: A Gamble to Lose to Ukraine? The number of damaged aircraft is around 10 to 13, some of them badly damaged beyond repair, but these are very very old Soviet bombers, even Tu22 (not to be confused with Tu22M which is a newer and much better model), which have not been used since 1980 (probably used for training). I can only say for Irkutsk Region because the base is nearby. It is an old Soviet base that lost its strategic significance in the mid-1980s and most of its strategic fleet has been moved to Bratsk. The aircraft in Belaya or Srednii as it is known today are quite old and of limited value, they also did not participate in Ukraine. To top it all off, a group of truck drivers prevented most of the attacks, they climbed onto trucks and smashed many drones with rocks. They will be awarded medals for bravery for this action. For whatever reason, the attack was carried out in a hurry because the drone truck simply stopped at a truck stop near the federal highway with an airbase in sight... but the truck stop was full of other trucks and people. Hopefully this explains a little about the situation in Irkutsk Oblast, everything can be verified by checking local newspapers and channels. As usual, Ukrainian and Western propaganda unreasonably exaggerates the number of destroyed aircraft and even mentions the damage at $7 billion. This is simply impossible because the entire program of modernizing the Tu160 (the fastest and largest bomber in the world) to the supermodern M2 variant costs $2.6 billion or about $100 million per new aircraft, including research and development. And thank you, Professor Brovkin, for your always excellent contribution. OFFICIAL SOURCE: source from : @SiberianTeddy"
Wait until Vladimir pulled out Russian artificial intelligence drones. Ukraine is not fighting their own battles theyre being helped by other the strategy to pull off such an attack did not come from them
"God bless Russian, Glory to Russian in Jesus Mighty Name Amen, Salam Alaikum, wa Alaikum Salaam,,,"
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto,Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,,,"
Terrorists worldwide now have a new tactic in their arsenal of mayhem.
Crazy attack tho
Fake news !!! People this fake war !!! Wake up
Isreal started this Ai drone thing
Scary stuff
Zelensky is still playing with fire again
This attack behind the America
Alex Karp of Palentir claims to set p targets for Ukraine military
Ukraine acting just like israel and all are including european countries with jews are only intentions for misguided to Russia into war ukrain have never planned to win over russia but America wants to Russia bow down slowly slowly into war because all way for America and jews cleared for one world orders where they do anything by way of devils path
Hidden in trucks ???? Crossing the border ??? From Ukraine to Russia ??? It seems there is no traffic so how is it possible ?
Ukrainians are Jews and Zionist . President Putin is a world leader .
"Putin or his field generals are insane, leaving all the planes in the same place. They should have been spread out across different locations. The very stupid comedian was simply ordered by his bosses, Trump, the European Parliament, and NATO to carry out this attack. He must respond with worse currency or with atomic bombs. I'm waiting, Great Comrade Putin."
Did poopstain say thank you for the gifts from ukraine?
Russia followed the New Start treaty that agrees that all strategic bombers have to be in plain sight at all times. Both Russia and the USA must protect the security of the other countries strategic bombers in these locations under this treaty! The USA broke the treaty when they allowed Ukraine to attack these planes. Not a win for Ukraine it is a huge loss for the USA as now no one can ever trust the USA in any agreements they make. Russia was stupid to ever trust the USA on any thing ask the Native Americans about American treaties!
Zelensky is asking for atomic bomb?
"This commentator, in my opinion: is alternatively gifted with false narratives, you will ask the question: why? I will answer you: the Russian Federation is a conglomerate of indigenous peoples enslaved by the Kremlin terrorist group, for a very long time. And on this scientific approach, the social aggregator for the decolonization of this terrorist entity is the entire enslaved population of these lands, even those who call themselves Russians."
"Its hilarious how these fools always report what Ukraine says as fact and wont disclose casualties, but are quick to do so with Russia and even interview the &quotvictims&quot."
Of course western media doesnt cover this real news. Thank you
Russia is a relic from the past...
This was dumb.. Those planes are bombers.. Nukes. They must be visible. Even the USA knows this.. Well Ukraine ur done now..
No doubts that they never told the Americans what they were doing.Just cant trust the US anymore. The US would have ratted Ukraine out to their Ally Russia with a smile.
"Magnificent. Absolutely beautiful. Go home russia, youre drunk again."
Its impossible to attack Russia without the help of US...
Not without usa help
"AS I PRAY TO HOME FROM WAR- 2025? Darling, I miss you more than words can tell As the torments of war burden my heart. I worry about you and how you are As by conflict we’re forced to part. As death confronts me, I witness first hand Just how sudden life can come to its end. At any moment war can consume and destroy Myself, my dreams, my enemy, my friend. Determined though fearful I dream of home Remaining focused, steadfast and whole. Praying for family, country and comrades The treasures of my existence and soul. I suffer pain, remorse and regret From actions I’m forced to employ. I have no choice but to do my duty As my solemn oath becomes my story. Remind our kids how much I love them And those moments they cry or play. I pray to be home for hugs and kisses Hopefully by night and Day. Most of all I pray for words That portray my need for your touch. I dream of you both night and day And sometimes a bit too much. Letters from home, loneliness, and sorrow Have made family more precious to recall. I love you so incredibly much As I serve with honor, and country’s call. By Tom Zart"
what happened to russian oreshnik. was it just hype:)
"Russia, China, Pakistan and North Korea military V Israel, India, USA, UK and France Military"
The claims of Ukraine and what they hit and destroyed are greatly exaggerated by western media and propagandists
Now Russia will respond very badly
"Now what will happen to Ukraine, the backlash from Moscow. Have to wait and see. God bless Ukraine."
American attack
Sees fire
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
Trump &quotYou don’t have the cards right now&quotZelensky &quotI have hundreds of flying Aces&quot
Al Jazeera is the best
The question is whether Vladimir Putin will consider this attack as an attack by the West because Ukraine cannot do this alone
War is no easy show. There is no walk over. How is such a country not even regarded as a super power doing so much damage to Russia? Is Russia honestly as powerful as they claim to be?
Slava Ukraine
"in Germany , Who has Hamburg ? Who says (We have Hamburg)? Olaf Scholz-Dead ,Jens Spahn&ampSusanne Daubner"
Erdogan and the Turkish government are obviously dictators and despots who have supported terrorism however they are very diplomatic and geopolitically useful
"Turkey in the English language is Turkey. This modern obsession with correct pronunciation is idiotic for two reasons: (1) No non-Turkish speaker will ever pronounce Türkiye perfectly without extensive training, and (2): It should be perfectly legitimate to use a different name anyway thereby each countrys language is equally respected. After all, München in English is Munich..."

Well done Turkiye 🇵🇰🇹🇷🇵🇰🇹🇷🇵🇰🇹🇷🇵🇰🇹🇷
"its not realistic to expect a final comprehensive peace deal from this in my view, but every incrimental issue affected by the war like grain shipments, prisoner exchanges or other humanitarian reconciliation efforts are a win for both russians and ukrainians"
"Indias Papa ( Russia) is beginning for peace, guess from whom, Turkey from Pakistan"
"So, Al Jazeera says that the Russian troops on the border are changing the mood of the negotiations. But failed to answer the question Have the attacks on Russia last night changed the mood? Instead Dimitri rambled on about another topic when asked."
"Telling Netanyahu or Putin: stop making war is like telling an architect: stop designing or telling a chef: stop cooking. They have this profession, war full of crimes, just like projects without calculations or expired food. The whole world is shocked by these two."
We are praying for peace and healing of both countries no more wars let forgiveness lead
Much more important: Why Türkiye don’t talk about freedom in Palestine Free Palestine
Türkiye has been doing a lot of winning lately. I believe they can help settle this. More than USA
Free Free Free Kurdistan

Join and go to die makes no sense
how many trillions of dollars have been taken from Russians in Western banks and holdings? How can there be a peace treaty without this been repaid?
My view is that the actions of 2014 were un called for. The government was overthrown back by Western nations.
Its ignorant to depend on other countries to pay for your wars.
I scrolled thru like 100 posts on iran until finally coming to just one old story on Ukraine. Are you journalists?
Plenty of closer targets in the largest nation of the world. Clearly ukraine wish to extend this conflit to a wider area. Suit youyrself
Slava Ukrain.
Who cares America stay out of it we have more pressing issues Iran. You dont want the USMC coming for you keep that in mind.
IM SUING OF THE WATERFALL
Trump and Putin may respond to this special military operation together
its wars of west against eastern nation no credit to ukrainian they have sold their soul to suttun and devil long ago.
"how in the world 2 nation that speak same language and almost have same culture fight a war which the people and the nation whom cause it do not share any of their values ,its missed up."
Russia vs allied forces 1 vs all
Russia will strike back at Ukraine...This conclusion follows from a message from Donald Trump after his conversation with our president. And apparently it will be either tonight or a little later.
Thank you Aljazeera for your pursuit of truth in journalism
Us has diamond and golds lets steal
Israel is a terrorist and illegal occupation fascist state
"I pray that Russia doesn’t retaliate this won’t go down well, this zalenski is trying to sink Ukraine. This should not be celebrated."
We all know RUSSIA LAUNDERING MAFIAS MONEY thru Quatar
I think free russian legion fighters involved at the attack
Big mistake.
"Ukraine is getting flattened after this, watch people cry about it in a few days"
Who knows how many shipping containers still lying dormant inside Russia waiting...
Russia has a right to self defense THIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO RUSSIA UKRAINE MUST NOT PROVOKE A NUCLEAR WAR ON ITS TERRITORY
So called advanced and cultured people are going to devastating the world again...
I just wonder how long Trump will order flags to be flown at half mast. This must be devastating to both him and his MAGA buddies.
Without internal help and hand this is near impossible. Looks like Ice is Breaking for Putin .
Where is S-400 and S-500 .....
"Wars and rumors of wars, book of Revelation"
"idk why everyones celebrating, what do u think will happen to ukraine now, now russia has more reason to do more horrible things, governments are scum, and nationalists are scum too, u know majority of the people in the world just wana live in peace and be left alone"
It means Ukraine doesn’t want peace Ukraine want to continue war otherwise this wasn’t the time to take this action while they talking about peace in Turkey
"Finally, Trump continues Bidens policy of stealing former Russian territories because of their wealth and approaching the US military strategic arsenal."
This is Nato Vs Russia war
Dont underestimate Ukraine we have the cards
Russia parasha
War attacks humanity first
No media says it was terrorism?
Allah zazira idiot
David and Goliath! (Soul) P.S. Not sure if Davids going to win this one?
She is so beautiful..just an compliment
At least Ukraine is serious about peace.
"&quotAn elaborate operation by the Ukrainians ...&quotNo. An elaborate operation by the Americans, you mean. Dont forget who started this war (in 2014, with the overthrow of the Ukrainian government), and who has been making this entire war possible all along. If the US shuts off the tap, the war ends."
What if an unknown sailing yacht sinks a US aircraft carrier.Did you think what was going on
Trumputin to Zelensky: &quotYou have no cards!&quotZel: &quotLook at this hand! I have aces galore!&quotNo praise from Trumputin?
"A historical event that will be in the war books, Ukraine still has the Trump cards."
"Putin is so weak and terrified, he’s hushing this attack. Almost no information on it in Russian media."
"As per the New START treaty with the United States, Russia has to keep their strategic bombers in the open so their numbers can be monitored. The US does the same.After this, I dont think Russia will be trusting US treaties anymore."
Some Russian generals must be feeling real nervous right now
Ukraine is just looking for trouble
See Like Russia USA CHINA UK EU have weak spots. India and Israel are aware.
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
Was it drones or was it the death ray that was used on Malibu????
"Putin attacks civilian targets. Ukraine military targets. Putins invasion of Ukraine was cowardly act driven by fear, greed and delusion. Its cheaper for Europe to support Ukraine now than if Putin ever succeeds in Ukraine, where he has already made clear he wont stop.Putin is responsible for the deaths of nearly 1 million Russians and hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. The Russians mostly men from outside Moscow, from the East of Russia, brought into the army. The Ukrainians suffering losses of soliders but also children, women, elderly, disabled through Putins targeting of civilian centres."
"This war will never end, in the past, America fought Vietnam for almost 30 years and the results were not as expected, and there are still many more wars that never end"
"This must be genious, how on earth have they driven a truck with missiles all the way through Siberia? Are there even paved roads all the way to Kamchatka?"
UK tax money burning on this pointless war
Key features of the operation: 1.Smuggled weapons inside Russia in multiple locations. 2. Stay undetected for more than a year. 3. Coordinate with agents inside Russia beside the intelligence agency of Russia 4. Launch them drones inside Russia. 5. Destroyed billions of military assets for just a 100 plus drones.
Zelenski is a foolish manZelenski crying started
Wish Palestine has this capability to defend themselves
US support russia attack?
"Why are you not talking about how the Ukrainians with US intel violated the NEW START Agreement? Those planes were out in the open specifically so that US satellites can see them. Trump broke the Treaty and you are shilling for the Trump administration. No its not props for the Ukrainians, these planes were sitting ducks because NEW START gives Russia guarantees of protection from the United States. Shame on you, shame on Trump."
They did the damages but now what their attack will be more furious.
Putin will respond at the appropriated time ....
well lets hope things dont go nuclear now
Russian retaliation is going to be insane !!!
"God have mercy on us All,God help us All,Amen"
"You kmow what W 1,2 caused by Europian colonialist today also W 3 cane because of colonialist Europian"
This is the Neto sabotage
The fools started the war against Ukraine! Moscow leadership is an axis of evil
Kiev could look like Gaza. Russian has been restraining itself. The west keeps poking the Bear.
Russia is preparing nukes
Ukraine to gaya abb
permainan yang bagus now saya menungu russia membalas serangan dan mempunyaii sebab untuk lebih ganas membunuh ukraine . saya sangt gembira di atas kehancuran ukraine dan sekutu seperti mana orang eropah dan nato menyerang negara arab tampa ada kemanusian dlm diri
Standing side by side with the Russian leader Mr. president Vladimir Putin and with the Russian peace loving brave people from the IK Pakistan
FOR 4OOO KM OPERATION INTERCONTINENTAL BALLASTIC MISSILES MISSION ???
Trump will be feeling deflated because he wasnt in the loop. Id be watching for signs of a coordinated response between Putin and Trump. Neither have spoken so far.
Pro Putin supporters would say this is fake news and Western propaganda..
I wonder how Russia would retaliate
And Europe wants de escalation???
Ukraine might already have thousands of drone hidden deep inside russia
Putin will not listen why not listen to your friend and end the war
Now objectives of this war changed. What going to happen next is full invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
Derailing trains carrying civilians. Purely Bandera-style.
It was called Operation Spiders Web.
"This was hard to watch so bad all those planes .(Level of Ukrainian maneuver and personnel inside Russia is more alarming), peace now this is dangerous development."
"Why would you wait for an official response from the Kremlin? Both Putin, Peshkov and Lavrov officially in public made clear many times that every single word ever spoken in the history of mankind by a Russian politician is a 100% lie!So why would you wait for lies?"
Thats why Russia doesnt want NATO to expand and refuses Ukraine NATO membership
Dont underestimate Ukraine
Man Russia has failed significantly.....
"Donald said he doesn’t have the cards , bluffed Donald bluffed ha ha.. fck russia"
Now Ukrainians are speaking the Language of Putin...... Respect Ukraine 🇺🇦
"Russia Lover, this is fake, this is AI"
did Russia know their air defence system was compromised to Israel by india for getting military support from Israel????
"This is Not a special operation by Ukraine, it is a special operation by NATO."
"As devestating as this was, you know Russia and the elite of Vladamir Putin are just going to look over their shoulders from here on out. Adding a very unnecessary and onerous pressure on Russia on top of everything else. Russia is in was could very likely be it doom spiral, Slava Ukraine!!!,"
Слава Україні!Героям Слава!Смерть ворогам!
t's nothing. We'll build new ones. The main thing is that the pilots weren't hurt.
You are trying American
Its unbelievable how weak Russia is. Those drone used to strike Russia airbase are just DJI home drone convert into military strike. Its so easy to penetrate Russia airbase and cause heavy damage...
34% of Russias strategic air fleet taken out with toys you can buy from Sharper Image.
"Howd that taste, Putin?"
Oreshniks should pay a visit to Germany France and Uk this attack has triggered a nuclear strike
zelenksy is a crazy animal
Operation website or operation spider web kikikikikiki
this was for the AN-225. in my opinion.
This is all on Putin Everyone in the world wants this war to stop besides him
I am worried for Ukraine now. Remember what happened to Japan after Pearl Harbor?
Only retards support dictator putin
Did some wake up Trump from his dementia stupor and let him know what happened.
"Great, Ukraine should exercise her power to defend herself."
All lies. They got hit way harder than they’re saying
Press the button putin
Shades of grim Beeper attack
The patient did not sleep all night
Russia is gonna retaliate
Zelenski is about to feel it.
Ukrainians need to fund their own wars they are just welfare whores living off uncle sugar daddy sam
Now lets see the nuclear power nation how could respond....
Game over
"If half the details are true, someone in Ukraine played too much &quotAce Combat 7.&quot Check out the storyline for&quot Ace Combat 7&quot - its a 100% match. And half the military bois are stupid for thinking this is amazing."
"They've already gotten to you too, Pypa, the brilliant geostrategist"
That was like the 5-0 that Paris gave to Inter.. slava Ucraine
Ukraine has choosen the path of destruction
Why is silent russian president The country wants a permanent solution to this situation I remembered a scene from a movie Enemies are not only outside the country but also inside . Indian are always together Russian
"And the best thing about this special operation: Imagine what it does to ru logistics, are they going to search every truck within 20 km of every military base? 😎 Ru is cooked!"
Putin the clown
slava ukraine!
Russia got embarassed! Clown Putin crying in his bed tonight
The antinuclear agreement forbids hiding of the nuclear weapon carriers. That is why the airplanes were not in the hangars. NATO forces Russia to make another Hiroshima like Americans did for Pearl-Harbor. Nato pushes all of us in the nuclear war.
Ukraine presice targeting military areas while Putin targets civillian areas! Shame on Russia
Now that’s a “special operation “
Glory to Ukraine!
What they are doing when all this happens
The true weakness of this battle is russia.bciz Ukraine attack military installation in russia.while Russia attack civilian in Ukraine.
No way CIA etc not involved.
Putin will choose ceasefire now.
This is US-NATO aided strikes on Russia
Its a wrong name for the operation as WEB..it should have been Optimus Prime
Zelensky a vile zionist who signed missiles in iIsrael to kill Palestinians is a USA puppet and needs to be ousted!
The response will be very devastating and catastrophic.
Ukraine needs to be in charge of NATO.
"Ukraine has made a BIG mistake, alarming for the whole world."
"Not bad for a guy with no cards . What do you think, Donnie?"
What air defence doing?
An annoying lapse of security that makes for good Ukraine PR but which does nothing to stop Russia from achieving its SMO objectives.
"This is no Ukrain and Russian war, because Europe directly involved given weapons to Ukrain that shows &quotYou fight on behalf of us, we will give you what you need.&quot Ukrain coukd nkt stand this long if they were not getting funds and weapons. You get my point."
Europ VS Russia
"That’s definitely done with the help Ukraine,NATO nd the US intelligence so heads up to all"
Ukraine has Trucks as their aircraft careers
russia not wanting people to film it so that they can claim it wasnt as bad and humiliating as it was
Putin’s blood pressure is probably currently at 180/120.
Slave Ukraini
So... I dont think the Russia-Ukraine war will be ended soon.
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,"
"I really dont understand the stupid weakling mentality of Ukrainians. Russia bombs the Ukrainian capital Kiev into 2077 Cyberpunk ruins every day with various missile drones As a result, Ukraine did not bomb the Russian capital Moscow, which is only 600 kilometers away from the Russian-Ukrainian border, or the second largest city St. Petersburg, which is 800 kilometers away, but went to bomb the Arctic Circle airport 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers away? Since they can smuggle a whole truck of suicide bomb drones to the Arctic Circle, cant they smuggle 20 trucks of suicide bomb drones to Moscow or St. Petersburg?"
Propaganda. Mainstream media is full of propaganda for the so called west. Lies sells better than truth. Report on whats happening in The Nation of Palestine.
"Attacking one of Russia nuclear triad means giving the reason for Russia to use tactical nuclear weapon in the war. Ukraine trying to get an upperhand before the negotiation but Russia will demand more as retaliation. Ukarine, NATO, and UK are fighting the losing war with Ukrainian lifes."
"“The fight is here I need ammunition, not a ride,” -Zelensky"
Cant change anything on the frontline
Slava Ukraini! Heroiam Slava!
"Well, at least nobody can blame Trump for knocking off 20% of the world’s GDP. Cause that is what could happen if Russia responds to this appropriately."
Kiev sarà rasa al suolo... Domani lUcraina firmerà la resa incondizionata
Russia trying to cover it up
My condolences to Russia. Such an embarrassment is hard to bear
did this... Not Ukraine.
"This is an American, British and NATO terror attack, just like Nordstream, on its own Ukraine cannot do this, this act is to degrade Russian nuclear capability."
Maybe Russia knew something was up so they Ukraine hard recently especially the drone factory
I guess this means the talks have failed already! I dont know why America is pushing for WW3.
"The Russian nuclear legs are getting shorter. Soon they wont have one of three if Ukraine keeps destroying their bombers. Ukraine also attacked one nuclear sub, working on the second leg of Russias nuclear capabilities."
Iranian Islamofascist
lol now westerners will cry when there will be no ukraine
This is America’s response to Putin jerking them around ! Ukraine does nothing without Trump giving the nod and helps with targeting etc
Operation Spiders Web
Peace Peace Peace from both ends.
Do you mean children that were kidnapped according to the international law??
"Ukrainians are Zionist and J ews. Do your research? President Putin is a world leader , I love Russia 🇷🇺. Ukraine president is an Isrealihell demon"
"Well, let’s not complain when Russia hit back!"
"FORWARD RUSSIA 🇷🇺. LONG LIVE LONG LIVE LONG LIVE RUSSIA 🇷🇺. STRENGTH STRENGTH STRENGTH RUSSIA 🇷🇺. VICTORY IS YOURS, FOR THE GOOD OF THE WORLD. THIS LYING NAZI ZELENSK: WILL REAP THE ROTTEN FRUITS THAT HE HIMSELF PLANTED. ALONG WITH HIS ALLIES. YOU CAN BE SURE OF THAT."
Russia has drugged this war so when you stupid u pay the price. Embarrassing nothing else
"During soviet time, Ukraine produced thousands of scientists, huge industrial capabilities. And putin really belived that everything will go smoothly.In 5 years stalin took berlin, in 4 years putin cant take kharkiv which is in 20 kilometres from russian border.Total joke"
The war will escalate this year.
UNLEASH THE ORESHNIKS!
India still holds the record of destroying 11 air bases in one operation. Ukraine trying their best with support from European allies. man will do a ceasefire just like he made between india and pakistan.
"Dont forget Gaza genocide is being sponsor by Human rights champion EU and USA see the casualties n fatality in Palestinians, still need to s of justification,, shame..."
"&quotNot confirmed by Ukrainian forces.&quot Yeah, russia did this to themselves. A false flag operation"
"Somebody forgot to report about Pakistani 11 air bases &amp body bags in those bases. Russia is exhausted and at continuous war, Ukraine is not nuclear power it is a big deal for Western &amp Arab media."
Your lower third is wrong. The Irkurtsk base is the far one. Murmansk is less than the 4300KM.
"Go Ukraine, invaders get out of Ukraine."
A Demilitarisation of Russia is going on by the plan
Amrica Israel jenoside in Gaza
World waar 3 starts amrica
And putin and 🇷🇺 still call nato patners very disgusting
Pootin said a 6 day operation! Its been 3 years!
Rossia will retaliate with the :&quotFront yellow back-down brown men underwear operation&quot.
"I'm Russian. And yes, I'm a real Zetnik and Orc. But even I admit the fact that Ukraine publicly disgraced and outplayed us. We've never had such a disgrace. Well done, khokhols. They publicly humiliated Ded."
"When you mess with Ukraine, you take the consequences. Now because of Putin, nowhere in Russia is safe. Nowhere."
"You got my attention and I am very proud you’re wise and very talented ( you &amp your team are brave dangerous to take on the current administration). If you didn’t announce this video and “fact check “ type of presentation, others are scared to do so. I pray for you and your team. We need your wisdom and bravery."
"Only 40? Ukraine should have said 100, since these clowns are just taking them at their word"
Something big is going to happen after this. Something so positive or something so bad.
"Winds, children of hurricanes, are approaching from the East, towards the makers of violence and death of the ""Maidanes"".From their arrogance of forces, who will prevail if they decide to play it all or nothing with their omnipotent and bestial gifts?The impassive, indifferent, will awaken in nightmare from their indifferent dreams.While the corroded ancient statues of imperial infernal egoisms collapse and fall into the abyss, dragging roots and bases with ancestral slaves, their pathetic agony with their typical colossal deaths."
"putin wanted this war and thinks nothing of killing innocent civilians, it is not quite so funny when it hits hard deep in russia,, putin can stop the war tomorrow if he wants but wont just to save his own ego."
Done by US in the name of Ukraine
"Whine more, pootins bots"
Rest assured Putin will not be humiliated. WW3 is coming soon.
A very intelligent operation against military targets. Big difference from invader Putin who cowardly attacks sleeping civilians during the nights. Which is a war crime
US-NATO-Ukraine attacks on Russia not helpful. What if they return the favor ? What then?
Slava Ukraine.
so there are ukrainian drone operators inside russia?
There shouldnt have been such a strong attack during the negotiations. It looks like the war will escalate towards Europe instead of ending.
"Ukraine attacks military bases, Russia attacks civilian houses, hospitals, schools, etc."
Now Ukraine will feel the Russian bear strike.
Enjoy Russia this is whats called a special military operation
Israeli drones as Iran's defenses were attacked
"This special military operation cost the Kremlin criminals over $2 billion. Glory to Ukraine and its heroes, its people, and its soldiers."
I bet the British did it. They always started wars. Where is William?
BRAVO UKRAINE! SLAVA UKRAINI!
Eeeh!! Soon Ukrainians are going to cry to
I think instead of an intelligence agency Russia has an agency of stupidity probably or everyone there is drunk
Is Trump watching. Zelesky seems to have cards
Putin is responsible for these escalations
"Ukraine has given its &quotMinerals&quot to USA, maybe thats why usa is helping Ukraine now."
You never want to strike a war with neighboring countries. I dont care who you are.
Once again Russia has shown levels of incompetence that are hard to ignore whether it was the invasion of cursed that they seemingly didnt know anything about before it happened or the latest attack on airfields and other examples can be given and you have to wonder why how in Gods name a country can allow this to happen when they are at War no wonder this war is going on and on like it has for the Great and Powerful nation that Russia is or is supposed to be these things keep happening and this last one is a really big setback for them lets make no doubt about it
Losing 40 planes in one day is huge.🇯🇲
Nuke NY city too
No world war3 please
Now Zelenski not only holds the cards but *rumps balls too.
And submarines
"This is a lesson for President Putin to trust the West, especially America. They have done this kind of thing in the past. They stab us in the back by calling for an end to the war."
Without western collaboration it’s not possible
The US will also perish via the Arctic
Russian military is pathetic. Shame
"Inglaterra primer objetivo , nuclear"
"Since Ukraine failed to hit targets with its hundreds of drones last week, it is resorting to NATO and US tactics. That is, sabotage and terrorism. It is time to blow up kyiv, since they still do not have it, or directly occupy all other territories without stopping. They can destroy kyiv, but NATO and the US will not stop attacking Russia. It is time for Russia to attack the British, in the same way, a civilian truck with drones and end everything"
Saved?
"The responsible to sabotage tomorrows talks in Turkey, is USA and the stupid Ukrainian so called presfient. He has bring the destruction very near of the area."
Guess Russia FAFO.
It was Trump who gave the order to bomb Russia to such depths in Siberia and Murmansk. Its obvious. Putin is a coward under the thumb of Trump and his neocons.
Dangerous development because Ukraine fights back?Only Russian plants are able to speak such utter nonsense.How much is Kremlin paying her?
I wish our US president was even half the man Zelensky is.
Eu ja sabia que a erussia o forte dela era forma balharinos
They used bombers to start Ukraine? I thought they used rockets and drones?
Skynet has been activated
Yess! Glory to Ukraine! Slava Ukraini!
Im waiting for pakistani puppets to comment over the credibility of S400
Behind every war there is Israiel if that is in Arab that is in Asia funding and supporting India for war and in Europe funding and supporting ukrine
I think this attack is made through the shift of USA’s policy on Russia. Trump’s gone back not attacking putin
"It is sad and shame for Russians, why Russia to move its NUK?"
Selva prove he always there for his country and people
ALL supplied by NATO-US. Our corrupted and controlled US politicians are supporting and funding 2 evil wars and want to start a 3rd with Iran
The war came home to Russia.
AL Jazeera is eagerly waiting for the response to report!!!!!!!!!!1
"They could not do it Without US/ NATO drones , explosives and intel , and more than likely , NATO operators . When will Putin go a pair and take the gloves off ? He has to !"
"Causing panic among the Russian people -who have enjoyed NOT needing to fear that Ukraine would bomb civilians this entire war, because Ukraine’s military are NOT monsters.Unlike Russian people, Ukrainians have been bombarded and do live in fear, because Russia’s leader is a monster!"
"Ukraina is clever , smart to not waste simply ammo blind defend they homeland ...."
Is this an escalation to nuclear war?
Some times rest.Control power.Thanks.
Ukraine crossed the red line. The night can be tough for Ukraine now
"West is playing with fire, they want Russia to nuke Europe"
NATO attack. Gonna be consequences.
"While we have a traitor in the White House here, the Ukrainians are taking it to the Russian Military who keeps sending an average of over 1,000 soldiers to their death in Ukraine. Way to go Ukraine!!"
Looks like the Iskander will take revenge
Gloves are off. Ukraine will pay dearly for this.
Get up Ivan!
Putin is worried not to post the truth on media .Embarrassing for Putin and Ukraine don’t attack civilians like Russians
While Ukraine targeted airbase and aircraft now Russia will target civilian infrastructure and apartments
Russia have same defence system they give to India and when Pakistan hit Indian Rafael world and Ukraine found out this systems weakness now Russia should ask India and India should ask Russia meanwhile China is chilling with Pakistan and others😅
Where are missiles from??
And Trump says he didnt know. The President of the US didnt know. Bet the CIIA did. World War 3 is coming to the Wests backyard.
"Ukraine has no such technology or capacity,so the west is behind,WWII inevitable"
next time ..... zelensky will be crying for ceasefire bcoz kyiv was attacked heavily
Can we call it The Day of Russian Aviation?
The only way Puter understands.
"This is the sign that Russians are playing soft in this war, while NATO and Ukraine are on War. Why Russia are playing nice to Ukraine and NATO"
This is indeed called Russia is being “Demilitarisation” by Ukraine
happy retards are not able to predict the respond
"its mean, Russian will start WW3? did the drone is giving by US/ Europe to Ukraine?"
The weather forecast says it will be very hot in Ukraine next days
Response will be disastrous. Stop celebrating.
This is clear stupidity of Comedian Zelensky
Ukraine shd stop poking the dragon
"Overseen by Zelensky personally remember the outrageous conduct of Trump you dont have the cards, this is historic. Congratulations to Ukraine and war-time hero Zelensky."
"I am gonna call this operation Tandoor,not Sindoor"
"NATO is putting a fight with anyone or any country that do not support its interest. NATO wants to rule the world and wanted everyone bow to it. NATO is no democracy and human rights. NATO cries for democracy and human rights if these benefit it. If democracy and human rights run counter to its interest, NATO is the greatest dictatorship and authoritarian alliance in disguise. NATO loses moral credibility. It has become an alliance of arrogance and wickedness. Many wars in Europe and elsewhere were created, instigated and promoted by NATO."
Israel the mastermind. Remember Israel was saying they will come for Russia
Regardless of where these attacks originated i dont see any excuse for not properly protecting those bases but maybe Im wrong
Al Jazeera deleting comments
War will escalate
Putin taking too long to long to flatten Ukraine . All show and no real substance.
Slava Ukraine!
Complete failure of Russian intelligence.
Nothing new. They been fighting for many years now so much property &amp lives gone but nothing new its all waste of lives money etc at the end of the day everything will be gone
"Dear Father, please give the Ukraine 🇺🇦 the strength of David, in Jesus name I pray, Amen"
The PutinBots and cowardly american MAGA knee-benders are seething in the comments right now lmao.
Nato is playing with fire..
Putins softness is Russias weakness..
trump : wow amazing wow
"Watching From South Africa,the people of Ukraine must let there president step down,to much people gonna die now over this strike,i wish this can come to end."
"Its not Ukrainian work, but CIA &amp Mi involve..."
"Do people today still think that drone attack was done by Ukraine? It is unbelievable. On the other hand, the signature id NATO is present and it is behind this attack."
"All these Ukraine bots in the comments . This has US and UK Intel hands all over it. This means nothing, Russia is still winning this war at an alarming kill rate."
Slavia Ukraine...
Sorry for Ukrainians
This is of course Natos operation in the name of Ukraine...
I can see the outrage when the reply hits
"Zelensky told to poutine to stop or you will regret, now who have the cards hey Donald"
Poohtin worshipping trolls are getting mad
Kiev doesnt want any peace. Ok.
Putin wants to take over Ukraine or if he can’t he will pound it to dust like Gaza or Syria .
"I am waiting to see how the Russian talking heads, the scott ritters, and rest will Spin this"
Why don't you talk about rail terrorist attacks? Attacks on trains?
When you play with destruction with your neighbour you must expect the same reaction from them .All of Ukraine was once the Russia Empire as was Poland Before WW2 most countries had integrated populations Putin and Zelenskyy should make part of Russia neutral and part of Ukraine neutral so they can live together in harmony.
Well hows that going to affect Trumps expertise at peace negotiations?Send TACO TRUMP in the mix.
Now when Russia wil response they all will play victim card
Is AJ crying or laughing?
Putin scum
This is ECO system
"Just imagine... you are a russian soldier, chilling at an airbase 4300km away from war and suddenly everything around you explodes."
Das goody
How can you not mention the 1400 missiles launched by Ukraine into Russia in the weeks prior to the Russian escalation? Or the assassination attempt on Putin?
....Preparing for doomsday.cya guys..
Using a disguised civilian truck to enter enemy territory and deploy FPV drones for attacks would constitute perfidy and be a violation of the Geneva Conventions. It could be classified as a war crime.
SLAVA UKRAINE!!!!!
"I am starting to believe, the formidable KGB that we thought were Russians were almost all Ukrainians"
"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, are you a member of the secret society skull and bones aka brotherhood of death?"
Ukraine can not do this alone.
Why is Russia trying to destroy ukraine?
"This is certainly a very successful operation carried out by Ukraine. It is not exactly like Pearl Harbor, but it is a very painful blow to the pride of the Bear and Moscow. But now, of course, after such an event, no one can talk about a truce at all, at least in the near future between Moscow and Kiev. Kyiv has certainly added fuel to the fire. It is possible that many countries will probably soon, if not ban, then at least limit the production and use of FPV drones. Earlier, I wrote that the president or high-ranking official of any country is no longer safe, despite the fact that they are well guarded. Can you imagine a well-planned action using drones against anyone or anything? I also wrote that with the help of such drones, one can effectively attack military bases, industrial centers and warehouses with goods, although previously these quadcopters were produced exclusively as a peaceful gadget and a toy for adults. It should be noted that politicians, businessmen and other interested parties who control the production of very expensive aircraft of various types and profit from their sales may also be concerned and against the further spread of such literally penny drones, which may minimize their greedy plans to profit from the sale of human-controlled aircraft, which in most cases are unreasonably expensive military aircraft with questionable efficiency, as practice shows. That is, by advertising such new samples of super-duper technologies to the public, as if these are new technologies that the country can be proud of, and as if they provide new jobs. But in fact, these lying and greedy people make money at the expense of taxpayers money by providing false information...."
I am pretty sure this was done by British MI6 and French Special Forces. Ukraine has no more soldiers left
Donald trump is forcing russia to negotiation table
"Russian: plz buy Indian defence system which neutralized 99.9% of drones missiles from Pakistan. It has integrated all radars ranges, interceptor, missiles with central control unit called AKASHTEER. It integrated S400, BARAK, AKASH, L70 in one system. This is better than iron dome, patriot."
Aaaahhhhh so lovely to hear F-.. Russia
"Russia being humbled in the most embarrassing way. Zelensky is the modern world’s greatest wartime leader. The burden this man carries in so many respects, including overseeing this operation. How dare Trump and JD Vance belittle him the way they did."
We cannot be broken!!!
"This was Nato attacking Russia nuclear triad not Ukraine. This was never a Ukraine war and it was always a Nato war. They are trying to take out Russia nuclear bombers to pave the way for a nuclear decapitation strike that will happen under Trump. He hinted at that already. Lets be honest, the war is not ending, it is advancing to the final round which will be a nuclear apocalypse. This is all part odmf a Demonic plan by the west to bring about the end of the world."
Wait for Russias retaliation
So if the rockets fly to Kiev in large amounts stop crying about it
Oreshnik is coming.
This is a sign of 3rd world war
Happy Malyuk Dag!
I bet you the Americans had nothing to do with this..
Putin should of taken that ceasefire. Ukrainians just got themselves a bargining chip because thats only 40% of its bomber fleet
"not blaming israel for this...? whats the matter? do you feel ok....AL JAZEERA? need some tea?31dead in aid center is gaza is israel, Ha? HAMAS IS MASSACARING IS OWN PEOPLE, and you blame israel for this. even when arabs butcher... other arabsm israel is blamed."
Tom Cruise has aged significantly since the release of the last Mission Impossible movie. 🫣
Putin got caught with his pants down. Thats what happens when you have a boyfriend named Donny Trump. Gloria to Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Some news to say Ukraine still alive. Loser country now begging Russia.
The putlerism-neonazism will fall. People are fed up with putlerism-neonazism and trumpism-neofascism
The ukranian bots d*ck riding on the chat is funny
I think putting will know he has lost this special operation.Military assets is gone.
Muslim traitor in russia
Ukraine with the active assistance of the West is trying to attack the Russian military assets to weaken it. Russia should abandon the policy of restraint before its too late.
Slava Ukraine
"I have never seen a country full of FOOLS and JOKERS. Ukrain do no even know what they are fighting for. They lost 50% resources to USA. And now, invited more devastations again..what for? USA Supremacy..Ego of one ruling joker is costing lives in Ukrain"
Slava Ukraine
Those children (russian speaking) have been evacuated from the war zones
Childrens wrre shaved from the sries that russia INVADED....uts like robers just saving money from a robbery the are convinced
Here is the proof that Zelinskiy doesnt want a peace. Because as long as war is going on Zelinskiy aible stay in his position.
This war will not end soon
Congratulations from Poland
"Had Russian intelligence been apprised of Ukraines plans, they would have found them utterly improbable."
That State of the art Russian S400-500-600 missile defence system is really getting a good return on its investment.
I am afraid... Putin the great will revenge us
"One thing Russians should understand is, there will be no peace in their country if any part of Ukraine is taken. No part of Russia will be safe as Ukrainians will be scattered everywhere."
Ukrainian are real worriers
Suck it communists!
Ironically we never saw russia hitting Ukrainian bases..In the media only Russia hit civilians but Ukraine only hits the bases
"Nato trying to make the perfect drone ,so they dont stop war"
"The prove Ukraine never stop bombing, or making terror act in Russia killing civilians. Expired Zelenskie do everything not making Peace deal at all. And always playing victim."
I know two things1-That attack made by USA-UK cooperation.2-Russias response will be scary!
Drones traveling 4300km?
Who provided this location? Russia have rights to take bold step.
Why dont the Russian people / soldiers rally/ protest for Putin to stop the war?
lmao get bent vatniks
wow amazing russian air defense. the most incompetent army in the world lmao
It will be nice from here Hopefully Zelensky n the west will not say anything about Russia retaliation
"Reports have said four airfields.However footedge shows aircraft NOT in revetments which is just foolish when on a wartime footing. Foolish, incredulous to the point of making any reporting accurate"
The operation was called WEB. Change one letter in the Ukrainian word for web and replace with U and youll get Putin.
"ARE YOU ALL OUT OF YOUR MINDS? WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO START WW3? TOTAL ANNIHILATION, MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION, CAN YOU GUYS ALL CHILL? WE JUST WANT TO LIVE OUR LIVES STILL."
"let us list the facts and you can decide who you think is winning in the Russo-Ukraine war.Russia invaded and occupied 38% of Ukraine in early 2022, but by October 22 after retreating in the east and up to today in 2025 they only managed to hang on to just 17%. Thats a decrease in the Russian temporarily occupied territories of 61%% ! (in real terms Russia in 3 years has only captured 10% new territory in Ukraine. heres why thats a fact - In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea - 4.7% of Ukraine. between 2015 &amp 2021 Russia occupied part of Donetsk (Donbas) - 2.3% of Ukraine, that equals 7% already occupied, prior to the 2022 invasion, meaning Russia has only captured 10% new territory in 3yrs 3months of war ! 😳 😲)Russia got defeated at Kyiv and had to retreat back to Belarus !Russia got defeated in Sumi and Kharkiv and ran away into Kursk and Belgorod leaving millions of tons of equipment for Ukraine !Russia got defeated in Kherson and had to retreat back across the Dnieper River !Ukraine invades Kursk in Russia and captures in 9 days, more territory than Russia captured in Donbas over 2 years !who do you think is winning the land war?Ukraine made Sevastapol in Crimea untenable for the Black Sea Fleet, making them leave their major regional naval base !Ukraine has in dock and on the open sea sunk or neutralised 450,000 tons of Russias black sea fleet, approx 67% of the fleet is unusable!Ukrainian activities in the Black Sea has forced the Russian black sea fleet to retreat all the way (600km east) to Novorossiysk in Russia.The Russian black sea fleet has barricaded itself inside Novorossiysk harbour to stop drones attacks from Ukraine, scared to come out.Ukraine has made the Black and Azov Seas untenable for Russias mighty black sea fleet and taken control the Black Sea region.who do you think is winning the sea war ?Russias air space force in January 2022 was 7 times bigger than Ukraines.Russia has lost 408 planes, 392 helicopters and 616 pilots in 3 years 3 months of war.Russian airforce wont fly in Ukraine air space for fear of being shot down by Ukraines air defence systems.in 3 years 3 months of war, out numbering Ukraines air force 7 : 1, Russia HAS NOT managed to take control of Ukraines airspace.Russia cant make enough planes to replace those being shot down or destroyed, but Ukraine has received new planes from their supporters.so who do you think is winning the air war?on top of this Russian casualties currently exceed 990,000+ soldiers and military equipment losses over 160,000+ pieces.You might want to re-evaluate your understanding of what has been going on and whos winning this fight!"
"Amazing operation. The Ukrainians carry out crazier missions every month and this has to be their masterpiece so far. The ocs were so worried about long distance large drones that they missed the trucks parked next to the airfields with small drones. Over 40 russian planes destroyed so far, and most likely, there are more. Its crazy how a small country thats only 35 years old can become a world leader in modern warfare in 4 years out of necessity. Drone warfare is the latest of modern warfare and Ukrainiane is the leader. Sure, America and other countries have big drones, but i would rather have a million small and cheap drones than a 1000 large drones. Large drones are not disposable and expensive and can be spotted on radar so naturaly the owners will keep it out of any risky situations while small drones are disposable and you can use a dozen of them on a single target."
This seems like more an airfield special military operation
Jocker has struck a hammer on his own toes
"When Russia gives the same favour back to Ukraine, Zelensky will start to cry out"
RIP Ukraine now its really going to humiliating for your country
Slava Ukraine
Putin got bent over
"Excellent. And, as opposed to Russia, they didnt attack civilians."
"Stupid. Ask yourself this : White Christians killing White Christians, who benefits ?"
Give Peace A Chance.
Let’s wait for retaliation
Ukraine trying all the ways to start WW3
This is a big blow to o Putin.....so he thinks he can fight with NATO
Let's destroy Ukraine with nuclear bombs.
Lets wait for russias 🇷🇺 response.
Trump will cry for his criminal friend Putin
Can Ukraine Sustain a Retaliatory Attack by Russia After this Provocation?
This will make Russia stronger not weaker.
This couldnt happen without specialist western help specifically targeting and operational aid.So when Russ14 decides to hit back hard watch the West cry and scream foul.This war is being made worse and kept going because of the west.Idiots
DEMOCRACY is action.
"Where was air defense ? these drones are doing what 5 squadrons of fighter jets could not do, maybe this event will change war fighting strategies on out. How do you protect air fields against drones??"
"H-3 airstrike, Ukraine edition.This strike is equivalent to the Iranian airstrike on the H-3 airbase during the Iran-Iraq war."
Are they going to turkey again for peace talk?
SURRENDER NOWWIN YOUR STATE HOOD
Nuclear was in two weeaks
Gammer army
"These planes are called the Bear long range nuclear bombers, some reports say 40 were destroyed."
Now watch out for Oreshnik rockets
"Ukraine is helping Russia join the peace talks, nice of them."
Now world knows .. who is the real joker
USA double game playing
"Comrade Xi, hit a brick with a brick in a brick face!"
Russia will respond in a big way of course.
King Cyrus aka Trump better step up
Ukrainian military intelligence is no joke
"Putin might not be happy and will counter big while grabbing more lands.Ceasefire wont happen anytime soon, only either 1 surrender."
Trump i will stop the war day 1 but bs we already going to WW3 UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINITRATION WW3 WILL START UNDER THEM WHYYYYYYYY
Russia must not spare Ukraine.Putin must go in hard otherwise he will regret
Slava Ukraine 🇲🇽🇺🇦🇲🇽🇺🇦
Norway. Murmansk is close to Norway border.
This is the sign of weakness of Russia!! Now we know that Russia is not a Superpower country!!Very poor defense ang too much poor war strategies!!!
I guess Ukraine does have some pretty good cards…
Its not Ukraine But NATO. This cannot be done with NATO nations participation of course.
"So, a NATO operation using special operators entering and exiting the country from either Finland or the Baltics."
Well return on investment.. Russia said it is demilitarizing Ukraine. Now who is being demilitarized?
Finland must have helped.
Putin must be no happy
"MILITARY VS MILITARY ,NOT LIKE GAZA"
Wait for the retaliation by Russia.
"Good evening, we are from Ukraine."
Wow! So no ceasefire
WHO DONT HAVE THE CARDS? can TACO answer???
GLORY TO SELENSKY!!!!! SLAVA UKRANE!!!!!
"There are videos out that show drones being launched from the trailers of semi-trucks. They drove them all the way there, and the tops of the trailers opened up and launched the drones. Wild."
I wonder what the response will be.Has Ukraine gone too far. We will see the outcome soon
"Nothing about this attack makes sense. Big planes aren’t used widely anymore. Plus, radar was not tracking anything? Plus they left them parked like it’s an air show? Sounds like an allowed red flag…"
"No matter how strong you are, you arent fighting unless your opponent is fighting back. Anything less is bullying, oppression, abuse, and cowardice, and nothing more."
Ukraine
"Good job, Brawo Ukraińcy"
This will only force Russia to escalate.
I am afraid what Putin going to reply.
"The West is continuously provoking and sabotaging and therefore wants the third world war, not peace!!"
SLAVA UKRAINA
"This is an interesting concept of &quotfight for freedom.&quot Being so far away from the front means that this is out of bounds on any means. I wonder what retaliation will be. Of course let us not forget that the goal of this ardent attack is to spread fear and derail any peace process. A peace process that is not mutual. It is a pity that people rejoice at terror acts and killing of other people. Watching it from the armchair as if this was some kind of a TV contest. And even if everything goes well, the average person gets the fallout from any military action. Those at the affected villages and cities will tell the real truth. Those who rejoice forget that their taxes go to kill other people instead of developing their own countries. This is like the Game of Thrones. Watching a movie with a sick content and even paying for it.... I advise all of the happy people to go to Ukraine or Russia and see what is truly happening. All the media is doing is inciting brothers and sisters to kill each other, so that the third party can have the benefits of the misery of the other two."
Ukraine is finished its made a big mistake
USA sponsored wars are a threat to all of.They are so stupid to tempt Putins patience.
"Take note, Taiwan."
Ukraine is helping Russia demilitarize
Toutes mes félicitations aux Ukrainiens
zelansky is a moron he doesnt want peace if he did he would provoke Putin
This reminds me pearl harbour. Hope this conflict ends here.
Allah akbar ! 🇺🇦🇺🇦
"Ukraine, be Israel, Say nothing, confirm nothing"
Ukraine could keep this secret for a year because the only war on msm is Gaza
s that dude Tom Cruise twin or what
No more Ukraine personal opinion
"Russia is the most weirdest country I have ever seen in my life. Beyond comprehension. You cant believe how stupid the inhabitants are, if there was a drone swarm in direction to moscow the people would still act like there is nothing happening literally brain dead. If russia didnt have any nukes they would loose on every front. The US would annihilate them."
"War Terrorism Is anti humanity acts Live with peace ,love and rule of coexistence"
Russia: dont look up. also Russia: FAFO
Russia will respond by targeting none military targets . They will do terrorism in response...
SLAVA Ukraine.FORCA Ukraine!
Russia is not ready for this.
Palestine jindabad
Would be interested to hear a dollar value assessment of the damage. Has to be huge
I Am indian but suport gaza jay hind

Red flag russian inside job
Time for Russia to retaliate!!!

The world will cry tomorrow morning and the world will blame Russia.
"Slava, Ukraine"
Ukraine are playing with the tail of a lion expect the worst from Russia....
The operation was next level.And Trump said Ukraine has no cards.
Stop the war save the children &amp woman both sides.we want to peace M Iqbal from USA philidhalipa N 7 street
And then there will be a respond and.......the cycle continues
Terrible
This is a very dangerous step taken by Ukraine. Russia can even drop a nuclear weapon any moment.
To all Ukrainian fans. Look at the map and just shut up. Losers cheering all day long.
"The Istanbul talks are just a way for Russia to give the orange r@pist a way to say Russia wants peace and then blame Ukraine for not surrendering to all the demands. Anyone with over 4 brain cells knows the only peace Russia wants is for half of Europe to surrender to the Tsar, starting with Ukraine. Shame on USA for supporting Russia."
Those airplanes were moved to those locations far from the Ukrainian border to protect them from theese kind of attacks…you can call it a major score…
At that moment Russian media large amount of it is calling for nuclear retaliation &quot World is going insane ? Peace is only answers !
Trump: You dont have the cardsZelensky: Hold my beer
Ukraine is a surrogate of USA. Trump is now playing a dangerous game.
4 bases at once…that’s a slapdown
Zelensky is war monger man.Never wants peace in the world.
The Russian Air bases successfully intercepted incoming missiles and drones.
Launched nearby.C I A.Seems US Deep State has enlisted Trump.Ukraine hasnt any capability to launch drones within Russia. Only a combo of CIA and US Air Force could infiltrate Russian air bases.
"Zelensky, the comedian, Mr. Putin, is also Zelensky the script writer! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
We all believe garbage Ukraine. Propaganda from losing country. Fake country losing land everyday and no option than now beg Russia for peace.
Russias big mistake is attacking civilians. Thats why people support Ukraine. Russians will never recover under Putin.
"Military targets , military targets , military targets , Ukraine attacks military targets NOT civilian targets 🇬🇧🇺🇦"
Free Ukraine 🇺🇦Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Where is s400
Ukrainian drone attack??? You mean NATO drone attack. Trump effectively shot down Ukraines access to Elon Musks SpaceX spy satellite surveillance of Russian territory. So stop this nonsense about Ukraines capability to hit targets deeb inside Russia +4000 km from Ukrainian boarders. Its a NATO EU lead operation. Pure and simple.
Putin looking weak af. Russia needs a stronger leader
Retaliation from Russia is a big concern now.
Pikachu face
I always emphasize that Russian only boasts about nukes and commencing WWW3 and have no other agenda.
18 months in planning? Could this so called war be any more protracted?
"4 ru$$ian airfields has been hit, no 2. Plus submarine base. The nuclear triad has become history. They were left with submarines and missile weapons."
Zelensky has the scalpel at Putins testicles!....
Zelensky destroying Ukraine to make happy USAGermany France UK sacrificing Ukraine military personals and Citizens to weaken Russia but Zelensky not thinking about Russias Heavy Retaliation which is Nuclear Power... Ukraine Citizens must pull down Zelensky from Power to save Ukraine to be occupied Fully by Russia
Stop the old zar wanna be now!
"Russia needs to make some Ukrainian glass, green-glass."
Russia is s winner country
Slava ukraine
People love to write off the Ukrainians and then they just keep proving them wrong this is massive imagine if America had half their nuclear bombers destroyed on the ground amazing
This could lead all of us to WWII
Israel behind ukrane training
Nuke Keiv
Falling debris
War will continiue now.
Russia must be thinking whos helping from within
David and Goliath comes to mind but instead of a stone its a drone
to bad trump wasnt there with his boy putie
This here is about pushed Putin to the edge. If he does not make mess now his ppl won’t understand him anymore. And nato was trying hard to achieve it Whoever called this shots is the one who wants to prevent peace at all cost Probably dollar ownersThey got beautiful luxury bunkers for their families
Ukrain is committing suicide!
YOU DONT HAVE IDENTITY FOR CALLING YOURSEIF NIGERIA BECAUSE NIGERIA IS BRITISH COLONIAL ARRANGEMENT FOR THEIR OWN ECONOMY INTEREST
"Everyone, just all go home."
No more vodka Popov
This is civil war now.
Is how wion is narrating.. kkkkkRussia is panicking because of destroyed airbases
putins 2 week special military operation isnt going so well
mandatory military draft for all white european men NOW!
Wasn’t Trump supposed to stop the war in 24 hours ?
"Who has gone crazy now,,"
Operation Ryazan sugar was transferred to railway bridges...
"Hhhh hhhhhhhh vive russe, bravo waouh super 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 alhadulilahi dieu merci beaucoup"
I wonder why chyna isnt helping russia
"Hey Russia, how is your 3 day Special military operation coming along ???? hahahah"
They will cry to America when Russia retaliates
HOW EMBARASSING RUSSIA haahahahaha
Isn’t this a war crime?
They will cry to America when Russia retaliates
There is no appetite for peace here. This war is about to go nuclear.
Ukraine’s just responding with the only language Russia understands
The West will keep fighting for the Russian resources to the last Ukrainian.
Russian army is the nr. 2 army in...Russia (after Ukraine).
Putin is Disaster for Russia 🇷🇺.Free Russia from Putin
The war began in 2014 when the Ukrainian military began shelling the Russian speaking population of Donbass
Ukraine just committed suicide.
Putin will not finish the year.
This is what happens when you invade another mans land. Russia should ask for peace. Its time for a peace deal.
ukies celebrating small victories then cry on 10x larger scale consequences: Russia is cruel
Kremlin Russia continues to cultivate disastrous karma.
The EU and Trump are Quite now he couldnt say anything again now he doesnt See or Hear what Terrorist actions Zelensky and his goons are doing
These attacks were co ordinated by The West ....
And why did ukraine just smaggled the drones into russia then strikes when their near by airport!why dint they just deploy then inside ukraine into russia
Those Children were forced into the army who didnt see videos of ppl even as 14yrs being forced to go fight to the front....
And thats the difference between Russia who bombs civilians and Ukriane who bombs the bombers bombing the civilians.
Wait for feedback.u will start claiming mbu russia is targetting civilians
It was shows how Ukraine doesnt need Peace
Hhmmm. I guess it’s just a coincidence that that this coincides with Putin making Trump look stupid trying to negotiate a peace deal .
Russia having effective air defense challenge: Impossible
They have spies in Russia.
Even Russia cant defend themselves using s-400 but india insists that they deflected every attack from Pakistan. Wow
that joker did it again. putin will laugh out hard
Everything is going according to plan now....Zelenskys plan!
Ahahahahahaha
Fake video
Ukraine has no elections. How sad.
tge world expects putin to accept negotiations abd ceasefire. it is only reasonable to let this be
Lesson for Russia for neglecting security protection..too busy at the border but fail to protect air base..
GLORY TO UKRAINE!
"Notice how Ukraine strikes military targets, while Russia deliberately strikes peoples homes using blitzkrieg tactics, just as they did in Syria. Russia is responsible for over one million deaths in Ukraine, Syria, Georgia, and Chechnya since 2000, while also housing Assad. How can anyone stand with Russia? They claim to be fighting Nazis and colonists while behaving exactly like the Nazis and attempting to take colonies. These supporters can try to dress it up any way they like. Still, the truth is they despise the fact that Eastern Europe and the Baltic nations are thriving without them, and Georgia and others also want to join the EU. They know no one would willingly be part of the Russian sphere thats why they need to invade nations and befriend places like North Korea and Iran. One mans desperation for a legacy and his band of paid yes-men have drained Russia and now sent it to war. How much can Putin and the oligarchs take before Russians stand up? Putin is the opposite of what Lenin stood for he is a modern-day Tsar and has the palaces to go along with it. The average Russian wage is lower than the minimum wage in Western Europe, while the select few live lives of obscene luxury. That sounds very similar to the Romanovs to me.."
Not ukraine but masked Nato
Terrorists channel
Trojan horse
Bravo!!!
Zelensky doesnt want negotiations. They are sabotaging the planned negotiations in Turkey their intention seems that Russia will cancel them.
Slava Ukraini.
"a very long match,who win the winner cup"
"Russia is such a joke, they attack children and civilians and cant even protect their nuclear bombers."
"Russia now has the second most powerful military in Russia, you reap what you sow."
Most days id be embassaed to be Russian but id be especiialy embarassed today. Clown army.
Thanks
Kiev about to have a real bad time
"Hello we are sorry to announce a breaking news. Putin used nukes on Ukraine , this is emergency broadcast peace"
This or pager
"Tomorrows breaking news,,,&quotRUSIA POUNDERS UKRAINES ALL MILITARY AIRPORTS&quot"
drones
let Russia and ukriane go at each other ... USA should withdraw ALL support and sit quite regardless of NATO ... Nato should NOT over-ride common sense ... !
well...ukraine needs to brace themselfs now and wait for the worse
Kyiv is written
BYE BYE PUTIN....... YOUR OLD DAYS AND YOUR OLD WAYS ARE NUMBERED!!!
Slava Ukraini
Bye Russia
Putin card is lost
This is one of the most creative hits on the russian military. This is why russia cannot win. The UKS made weapons for the ussr and now we are seeing why.
Big Russian security lapses
"Wasn’t Russia heavily criticized for launching air attacks during negotiations? But now Ukraine launches air attacks the day before negotiations a,d that’s a good thing?"
2 billion in strategic assets destroyed by cheap drones rigged to blow. 21st century warfare is interesting to say the least
Ukraine should not cry when Russia answers this attack. You cannot fight a superpower.
Free Palestine
I dont think this is good for Ukraine. The statehood of Ukraine is under question. The west and Ukraine are ignorant about Russias nukes!
NOW TRUMP KNOWS WHY ZELENSKY WEARS HIS UNIFORM. THIS IS MASSIVE AND IMPRESSIVE. VIVA UKRAINE.
Fake news. Is AI
"War, Please no war"
"So, everything is unconfirmed? What Ukraine sources told you anything? Seems like Russia bombed their own airbases. This gives them the excuse to attack Ukraine! And, Russian air power is of no consequence to this war, so blowing up aircraft is mostly meaningless. I dont think Ukraine wasted resources on this. They dont have the resources to justify these actions. Maybe they take credit for it anyway. Why not? Like the 2 trains in Russia. FSB did all of these attacks. No pilots or ground crew were injured in airbase attacks???"
This could be Russia’s Pearl Harbour.
Russia hasnt announced anything!!! Theyre hiding behind Putlers skirt.
Ukraine made a big mistake !
This wouldnt have been possible without the help of the West and Russia will see it as that and will retaliate hardly on Ukraine soil!
Time for Russia to pull the big bear out
Ukraine bombs military targets while russia kills civilians.
This Is Evil
what next
Russia hahahahahahahahaahahaaha
"Most people on here are just extremely stupid. Not just stupid extremely stupid and brainwashed. Clearly, no history education whatsoever...."
Dangerous pokes
"LOOK at all the Zionist unit 8200 in the comments....hilarious. The world isnt stupid, we dont like Zionist USA/izrael/ukraine."
"Its a major loss of face for Putin. And it destroyed billions in value, a Tu-160M costs 270 million dollars each. Strategically it might not have much impact as russia is slowly building new T160M. Except maybe forcing them to redeploy air defense from the front."
Alemanha anuncia que Kiev já pode usar as suas armas na Rússia. 26/05/2052.
Special operations by Ukrainian intelligence are never repeated.
"This is how a ""special military operation"" is done!"
Are these red lines or already brown?
"Wonderful! Murmansk is east of the Norwegian border with Russia, ie, in the Arctic"
Now Russia headed for peace talks in Turkey after the pounding.
Today is International Day for the Protection of Children from Russian Bombers.
Proxy war between NATO and RUSSIA ..
Another attempt to stop the peace negotiations.
Russia is weak.
No need for long-range missiles or long-range drones. Ukrainian intelligence delivered a truckload of dozens of cheap drones right to the airbase. Brilliant!
Malaysia noted..🇲🇾
So this is not Ukraine this is clearly a cladenstine operation carried out by Nato under the disguise of Ukraine.
"This time the Ukrainians and NATO allies were more cunning than the Russians. From what I understand. They sent like Amazon packages, in anonymous containers the drones to depots near the air bases, within their limited range. The drivers were unaware of what was inside the containers. At the right moment with remote controls they lifted the lid of the containers and fired the drones, which guided by NATO satellites hit the nearby targets.I think the Russians will not be fooled a second time."
The Ukrainian army is the most creative in the world.
The guy in the thumbnail looks like tom cruise
Russian intelligence orchestrated a train wreck to get out of the negotiations without angering Trump. Analysts recently predicted this.
russia has nukes
Hardly every see them giving news in an unbiased way.
"This operation is Mission Impossible type stuff, wild"
Crocodillo Bombardilo was also destroyed
They just cant stop fighting. Wtf. And draining other countries money and defense
"This is called surgical strike on real military bases, Not like Indian ones, where you lose a pilot sometimes and other times 5 jets"
Russia will retaliate and Trump will bark at Putin
Now theyll kill civilians in return. Anyways i believe the S400 was grieving the loss of its indian cousin destroyed of Pakistan on 10th May thats why it couldnt intercept these drones😮
Over 40 strategic bombers and an AWACS A-50 aircraft destroyed.........thats gotta hurt putin big time!
Retribution is coming. Lectures are being written.
So ukraine ruined its chance of getting peace talks and a cease fire. Ukraine loses again
"If airbases, tanks, armor, artillery, troop concentrations, and large warships can be obliterated by drones, much of the conventional weaponry now deployed by the worlds militaries, is obsolete."
Russian response will be dire
А кто за всеми этими событиями стоят нужно предметно разобраться.И наказать военным путём.
Putin undermined Trump forgetting that the geopolitical world order must be led by business people not well cooked not politicians Trump knows politicians in and out his moves are good for the American people and South Africa global stage
USA and EU technology is too hot to handle for Russia
interesting
Sorry Aljezera
Russia IS A TERRORIST AND CRIMINAL STATE
“Peace talks”. Putin is the problem he needs to be arrested.
They still going at it? Bunch of immature idiots.
SLAVA UKRANIE HEROYAM SLAVA SLAVA UKRANIE HEROYAM SLAVA
Obviously a huge number of Russian trolls in the comment section. Someone should bot scoop the screen names.
"Now more and more deaths in Ukraine, Zelensky is a mad cow he escalated the whole situation."
There will be no negotiations with this jerk. A piano on his head.
The clown will cry again in media after Russia retaliation
GLORY TO UKRAINE HEROES
Stop calling Zelensky president. Hes not the president.
This has Europe written all over it.
"I propose razing the Rada and all those present, the Bank building and all those present, and a dozen more checkpoints. Start a real hunt for Zelensky. This comedian has already done a lot for the ""world."""
"Finland , Norway ??"
Lets c how putin replies
The response is going to be huge.
Ukraine incapable without aid from the west
Putin is bluffing.

"“Dangerous escalation “?????? Ooh yeah, Dorsa is speaking from mosCOW"
My comments keep getting deleted on here. Trying to control the truth is funny. Anyways long story short.seeing this
"Bravo, bientot la fin des terroristes ruSSes"
This is bad! Not good at all
SLAVA UKRAINI !
NATO stepping in because Ukraine is too weak. The Bears response will be most definitely DEVASTATING
Just say it... Its a.... Special military operation done right lol
This operation was prepared especially by US Government! US should confirm it but not Ukraine because its just a puppet state.
"Wheres Russia s400 air defense systems??? Iran should have sense now, dont depend on Russias s400 to defend your airspace. Cos if Israel is ready to decimate those nuclear sites, they will"
The drones were equipped with object recognition technology.It &quotsmells&quot Norwegian Kongsberg missile technology from afar.
Duuuuuude this is Gona be a movie 10 years time
Al Jazeera is mini USA backed-Isareal news channel or Anti-muslim or genocider States
What the air defense doing? Smoking krokodil and drinking vodka?
Glory to the Heroes of Ukraine
By the US and NATO
Glory to Ukraine
Wait for a reply from the Russian king
"Considering who in Ukraine these planes bombed, today is truly Children's Day."
Something big will happen we are on the stand watching….
Excelente !!! Todo ha cambiado y David le gana a Goliat !!!!!!!
"Note - a military airfield, not a pilot's town where children run around the yard.And what is RFaShuZm doing?.."
Wait couple of days Mr White powder zalensky start to cry
DEWs.
Those who think this is good for Ukraine are wrong. Russia will double down on bombardments and drone attacks.
***k the negotiating table...... If Trump would just cooperate with intelligence alone and Europe should help push Russia out of Ukraine..
sad day for the 0rcs
Simple solution.... Orcs go home and stop invading sovereign territory.
This is called &quotLong distance special drone operation&quot
Protect warplanes with anti-drone mesh. 2 or 3 line protection will save costly plane
"Amazing. Ukrainians never cease to amaze me, theyre very clever. Just think about it, inside Russian territory in a coordinated strike on airfields which have multi million dollar jets parked neatly on line. This was really a Special Military Operation on a grand scale."
can drone fly 4300 km range ?
Ukraine 🇺🇦
"These Turkish Shongar drones didnt work in India , more than 400 got neutralised by Indian integrated airdefe*nce system of India which were sent by Be*ggarstan few days ago ."
How Ukraine got the capability to do that. Let us wait the response.
"Russia hit civilians, Ukraine hit strategic targets like military bases. This is NOT escalating dangerously, it is the opposite of that."
"It seems NATO never respect the redlines of war, just like srael. NATO uses Ukraine to attack deep inside Russia"
Mail order brides sould be pretty easy to meet with now.
Why are Russians so incompetent? Lazyness or alcoholism?
Ukrainian Special Military Operation!
Ukraine are always one step ahead this is big attack
PUTIN IS GETTING GADDAFID
Russia asleep at the wheel.
"So, you’re telling me, that russia is still a threat to NATO? Ok."
"Russia, let em have it. Send it."
took too long
Trump deserves no media time
THE RUSSIANS ARE CUMMIN THE RUSSIANS ARE CUMMIN
Thats why Russian claim of Nato being in Ukraine is valid and thats why it need it to be a buffer zone.
Oreshnik will speak sooner
"Oh, its on now"
Ukraine dont want peace.
Rusia
"All coordinated and happening back to back. Please let me know when you see the outrage. But wait till Russia retaliates all these. You’ll see the mainstream media at work. Israel has literally leveled Gaza beyond recognition because Hamas carried out a provocative attack on October 7, 2023 that lasted less than two hours, if I’m nit mistaking. For that, they still justify their continuing military action till this day. But Russia gets vilified for responding to sovereignty-threatening attacks from Ukraine. I guess we all know why."
How is the SMO going?
They got some drone into the world biggest country to hit civilian planes flowing in ISRAEL footsteps after bombing Yemen only civilians airplane Im disgusted.
40 Russian bombers destroyed in a single day? Russia is weak to other nations as this point.
"How about if Putin sends 10,000 at one time instead of several hundred every few days???"
This is huge
"Stop smoking on military airfields. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
"So, ok.. First of all, I dont believe this story for two seconds, and let me explain why.. In order to believe this story, you would have to believe that that a military drone, that is capable of flying ROUGHLY 1850 km WITH satellite-assistance, made a near 2,500 km trip and flew THROUGH Kazakhstan airspace for the shortest possible route.... Sounds like B.S. to me.. Theres ONE up close video, and everything else is from far away... Its likely Ukie propaganda like most everything else."
why does Al Jazeera call this a dangerous development? Taking sides are you? As if we didnt know.
"IF PUTIN IS INTELLIGENT, THEN HE WILL STOP NOW.BUT HE HAS LOST HIS MIND LIKE A RABID DOG !THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE MUST STOP PUTIN."
they should not cry when Russia hits back
nothing to see here - lol
Ukraine don’t come crying tmw when Russia hits back
REPENT mankind the reckoning is HERE!
stop this war
note how Ukraine always targets military installations while putins pedos mostly target civilians
Enough time for both Russia 🇷🇺 and Ukraine 🇺🇦 to live in peace
"This kind of attacks is provoking Russia to use their nuclear bombs, its not good for the world at large. Ukraine should avoid the war and come for peace with some compromises."
You will see now how Putin will destroy
Dorsa needs to take it easy one lip fillers
I strongly condemned this attack on Russia. Russia has right to defend itself.
STAMBUL TRAYTOR.
"Ukraine has proved Russia is a paper tiger, I bet the Rus top brass are fuming"
Haha liar
Russia and Putin .. NATO is clipping your wings before the attack you. And u still call them partners.
This will help Russia achieve reconciliation.
"If Russia was USA, Ukraine would have collapsed within 2 weeks even if Ukraine received military support from Russia"
"Bad things about to happen,,,,,No more peace talk,,,,"
Ukraine hits military bases and production facilities whileRussia hits hospitals and childrens playgrounds.
Why doesnt russia stop the war is this war even meaningful now ?
Zelensky is not for peace ! Thats clear .
"If the west want something they will get it, even if they have to use the blood of other countries to get it.Western foreign policy is the evil in all this."
Special operation from Kiev also killed civilians when they hit a bridge when the passengers train was passing!
No one wants peace.
The 2nd Pearl Harbor in Russia
Ukraine should just expect something bad then what they have then wait tomorrow night just after tomorrows meeting
Going to feel sorry for the innocent people of Ukriane what is going to come to them. Russia is going to unleash h_ll on Ukraine because of this attack!
Looks like the US has entered the fight.
Its finnna get hott
I’m sorry about Ukrainian people for having comedian as their president
this will change warfare for ever if true
"When the repercussions comes, the west will scream so loud no one will listen to them."
audacity of this all. hoping it does not escalate beyond control as Putin would be smarting under this. this is not looking good for the world if this is all true.
Gratulation aus Deutschland
Now Just Wait for Response
Mossad is involved
"Indian Army was relying too much on S-400. Pakistans JF -17 launched CM-400 AKG and took out two S-400 batteries (out of total 6 batteries ) in the very beginning of the Operation. For CM-400 AKG, S-400 is a sitting duck."
This is what you call war ... not isreal vs. gaza
NATO
"Excuse me, dangerous development? Are you kidding me. This is war."
Nuke ... nuke...nuke....
John hendren get out of kyiv something big is going to happen May Allah save the Innocents

"This is the stuff of Hollywood! Mark my words, theyll be making a movie of this, and you can be sure Ill be watching it!"
Russia vs NATO war mongers. Living in a civilised world of DEMON CRACK
Pearl Harbour in Russsia and this time Lendlease goes to Ukraine and not Russia hehe
Russia is a terrorist state. And threatening the world. The whole world should be outraged
"YouTube, EZEKIEL 38 wars.Countries destroyed for opposing the Palestine occupation. Somalia Sudan Libya Yemen Afghanistan Iraq Syria Lebanon Palestine Russia Rohingya Uighur Kashmir Kosovan Iran."
Anyone fighting for Putin is dumb.
BG..... what is she doing there??
Ukraine has a better army than Russia Russia your torn up you need to sit down and go to negotiations cuz youre tired
"Calling this a dangerous escalation is disingenuous or misunderstood. These bombers strike civilian targets and terror bomb Ukrainian cities. SBU have also confirmed that his is their operation, codename Spiderweb."
NATO at it
very good as we all know putin will not have a ceasefire
Russian intelligence unit failed massively.
"Russians cant build those planes anymore, they dont have the know how. Cavemen will have to crawl without planes now lol"
"I wonder what Putin will be thinking, after three years hundreds of thousands of my men dead, $200 billion plus spent, every now and then smoke billowing over the skies of Russia and i am yet to cross the Dnieper"
Now they are speaking putins language.
Im afraid zelenskyy gonna cry soon (
Dont cry when Russia responds
The never ending war.
"Today's attack will be a turning point in history, like the Battle of Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese War."
Slava Ukraini!
Slava Ukraini!
"Go home, Ivan."
Great to see! Slava Ukraini.
Dangerous development??Putin is Dangerous and must be stopped.
"SMO converting into War its called real escalation ,i think After this Two things gonna happen Fighting end or all out Comedian"
Welcome to UKRAINE!
FAFO
When Russia responds then Zelenskyy switch on his camera!
"This is what you call a “Special Military Operation”,"
Tomorrow is coming tell that comedian not to cry
Israel style operations.
What a waste of lives on both sides..shame on them in charge...
"Peace talks? Oh please — that would totally ruin the war economy! Looks like Ukraine and the West are more into profits than peace talks. War is just great business for politicians, after all."
"Now russia has his own Pearl Harbor, but without happy end"
HA! HA! - Nelson
Trump: you have no cards!Zelenski: hold my beer!
Make sure Trump keeps his mouth shut as he has done now when Russia retaliate
The dogs in the West want to start a nuclear war. We all know can’t walk a dog without getting the leash from the eu and us
These drones probably came from Finland
A football field of drones can wipe out a football field.
The big question will be how will Russia respond to this massive attack ?
this attack green signal for Trump
If no side has confirmed then how can you report many bombers were hit
"The small drones were hid in a false roof in a shipping container, when the container got to its location the false roofs opened up and the drones took flight, zelenskey personally views the operation which was planned 18months ago"
"If Russia killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than Israel killed Palestinian children, does that mean that Russia is four times less fascist than Israel?"
Russia should pull troops out of Ukraine. They have enough weapons to fortify its borders if they think is about security but thats not the case.2022 was pure invasion of anther country.
"Chapter: The Approach Of The Hour
 Anas reported that a person asked Allahs Messenger as to when the Last Hour would come. He had in his presence a young boy of the Ansar who was called Muhammad. Allahs Messenger said: If this young boy lives, he may not grow very old till (he would see) the Last Hour coming to you. &lt&lt Sahih Muslim 2953a &gt&gt"
If Russia retaliate back d west will start complaining
Putin will be filthy over this.
"I heard the Messenger of Allah say: He who lets his garment trail during prayer out of pride, Allah, the Almighty, has nothing to do with pardoning him and protecting him from . &lt&lt Sunan Abi Dawud 637 &gt&gt"
Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine
Zelensky now he will face a terrible attack from Russia.
Now lets not cry about ceasefires when russia responds
Remember Mariupol!
LOL..Ukraine embarrassed Russia complitely.
High-precision fragments pa-ruSSia forward
And tomorrow theyre going to peace talks? Must have a significant threat up their sleeves.
Nuk is loaded now
Ukraine will lose the entire land and still they are playing with drones
Ukraine is just helping russia de militerize itself.
Zelensky is the responsible for all this he earn lot of dollars and work with NATO he must be stop the war because innocent people suffer and die in the war not zelensky and his family..
So glad to see Ukraine is no longer being held back by US cowardice and complicity with Putin
Thanks aljazeera
Trump was DEVASTATED when he hears the news. His Russian &quotpeace plan&quot just went through the window...
While Russia is hiding to confront NATO by pretending it is purely Ukraine war so now NATO is getting more aggressive while still maintaining the drama of Ukraine war when even Ukraine was defeated 2 and 1/2 years ago just in first few months of war and from than on NATO is directly fighting Russia and Russia is pretending it is Ukraine war and NATO is getting free pass and Ukraine is destroyed by NATO and Russia using it as battle ground for themselves where NATO is killing Russian soldiers without consequences and now NATO is also hitting inside Russia constantly and Russia not hitting NATO by pretending that Russia can win the war by pretending it is Ukraine war and by killing civilians who are dragged from streets by Ukraine warmongers and are thrown as fodder in war by giving them uniform and a gun and calling them soldiers when they are noway any soldiers
Crazy Nato provocation
Russia is weak.
France &amp UK masquerading as Ukranians
Ukraine Russia nebour countries and Russia is big and powerful country so Ukraine should be talk and solv problems easily why you playing American football
Ukraine just made a mistake and now they are gonna get it
They collapsed a bridge onto a passing train too...
Attacked by NATO 100%
Europe will not let Russia win.
How do drones fly from Ukraine into Russian territory without being detected or intercepted?
Now its full scare war. End of peace talks.
The same s400 deployed during Indo _ pakistan conflict and said it had shot down multiple drones and aircraft i doubt about its ability and realibities
"Like the Gazans, the Russian are FAFO"
Slava Ukraine
These only told you zelensky is not interested in peace
Nato
I dont know what Putin still waiting for
"Oh, I bet Thats upsetting..."
Zelensky will not be of this world for long.
"Bro, I bet putin is a tad bit upset."
Your have to say slowly the speech because for work out
Newsreader is showing a little bit too much legs. Please cover up
Am very confused now. where is Russian air defence system...
"Wars and rumors of wars. Lord Jesus is coming soon, Repent, believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again"
What a wonderful job India has done Pakistani army attacked Indian airbase with 300 to 400 drones and missiles but India shut down everything but Russia could not do this.
Thank you
Slava Ukraini
Russian blaming Ukraine and Israel blaming Iran and its proxy are new normal
Russia does not negotiate with terrorists
There must be plenty of dissidents in Russia. Bridges are always vulnerable unless closely guarded.
There are NO Russian civilians in the region around Ukraine
Terribel .
Lets help Ukraine get its cities back.
Rusio estas sekura nenie! Slava Ukraine!
&quotBlame&quotHow about Russia spends its tax revenue on its own country and its infrastructure instead of blowing up its neighbours cities.Just a thought
Osama bin Zelensky
True news source From India
"Russian civilians thought there was would stop in Ukraine! So now the Russian civilians are testing the real side of a taste of what is happening in Ukraine. Lives,"
so this is MILTARY TARGET looks like in Ukraine eyes
Bumerang returned!!!! Slava Ukraini!!!!!
"Why Russia is too lient to destroy Ukraine government,l? Delay is dangerous"
Boo hoo
War comes with consequences all the time civilians suffer too
A bad news day for AJ.
Don’t cry When Russia replies.
So when Russia sends Rockets into apartments in Ukraine is this a Terrorist attack ??
Didn’t you forget to say there were women and children among the dead according to the Gaza ministry of health?
And then ukrainian terrorists will complain why Russia did the same.
"50% chance its local sabotage, 50% chance its just incompetence."
FIVE BUCKS ITS A CIA AND MOSSAD OPERATION.
Gravity brought the bridges down and all those airplanes just spontaneously combusted.
russia finding out lol
"are these news showed on euronews, cnn, abc?"
Russia needs to leave ukraine
Such attacks are extremely sign of desperation and its seems Ukrainian lost ...
Russia needs to leave Ukraine.
Its an all out war now......... peace negotiations will not prevail anytime sooner
"So when Russia retaliates with 500 drones and missiles, Zelensky will whine to the media about Russia not being serious about peace talks."
"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, are you a member of the secret society skull and bones aka brotherhood of death?"
"President Of Russia Vladimir Putin, are you a member of the secret society skull and bones aka brotherhood of death?"
"Terrorism, war crime. It was a passenger train."
"Its fair now, dont play your victim card when Putin retaliates."
Did China build these bridges??? )
Ukraine have changed tactics
Were the attacks on Russia unprovoked?
Typical Russian infrastructure
Criminal Zelensky dont want peace and want to sabotage dealsHe is a criminal playing with innocent lives of his people
I love Dorsa Jabbari lips
From Pakistan 🇵🇰 Im thinking when Ukraine has admit its defeat many times then why both countries are not moving towards end of war. Its USA and some western countries getting benefit from this war. And using Ukraine as just scape goat
Ukraine engages in terrorist attacks before &quotpeace negotiations&quot
UKRAINIANS should brace
These illegal migrants being deported should go to Russia 🇷🇺 there is plenty of work there
"Yes, it is a terrorist act by Putin"
"Bridges, especially railroad bridges, have ALWAYS been legitimate military targets. Any, repeat any. wrongdoing was on the part of the Russian Military by allowing civilians to use a military supply route. Same thing as the British did with the Lusitania in World War 1."
Their &quotmilitary operation&quot is haunting them. Putin is to blame.
"Thats not blame, it is credit."
Two briges with civilians trains attacked in Russia.
Maybe starting wars over imaginary lines on a map caused it. Ignorant world leaders. To bad regular people die for such power-hungry egos.
Putin is incontinent and blames Ukraine
Ukraine fights like Jews
This war will not end until one side beg the other.
Ukraine
Russian
The West and their zionist Israeli slave masters took their gloves off on Russia!!
"KGB/FSB is notoriously know for killing russian people, also with explosives."
"Well, don't be offended later if a train with civilians is a normal target for you."
Nato
"This news media is a pro Islamist, terrorist funding and a rogue media group"
Zero condemnation from the west. The response will be more devastating and then well hear Trump and western media accuse putin of being crazy.
This reeks of sabotage.
Civil war broke out in UK 🇬🇧 already
You cannot defeat 🇷🇺Russia
Brace for devastating response
Ukraine is Russia let that sink in
"i can say for sure, this bridge was not hit by a ukranian explosion. lmao this has &quotdog ate my homework&quot energy - embarrassing incompetence"
"what are they crying about, they do this to Ukraine on a daily basis. Ukraine does not aim for civilians"
"Well Russia wanted war so it got war &amp its people suffer for Putins choices , it’s the same with every war - happens in Ukraine too."
The west hav now turn to terrorism
They forgot the war was not over and already cruising through a war zone
Thanks aljazeera
They wanted to live a normal life in a war zone
"I wouldnt be surprised if it was either agents of the C.L.I.E.A. directly, or, in the least, C.L.I.E.A.-funded Ukrainian operatives who are pulling off these attacks. I wouldnt put it past the C.L.I.E.A. to go behind President Donald Trumps back and perpetrate these attacks. We know for a fact that the C.L.I.E.A as well as the F.B.L.I.E are, for the most part, rogue government agencies that rarely follow the laws of the U.S. Constitution or adhere to the Bill of Rights. And, most certainly, these two agencies ignore international law, the International Court of Justice."
Russian engineering
"Typical, Ukraine attack day before a peace talks. Same, as before 1st talks. Now, a ceasefire is off the table until peace agreements are reached."
Putin will say global warming is the cause
It is (using Western propaganda English) an Act or Terror. No two ways about it. Waiting for Trump to react now.
What EU and US called this ?
"Why would you ride a train in a war zone? So irresponsible. It is as if the dumb peasants are unaware that there is a war, and also unaware that russias war logistics are mainly train based."
But bridges collapse also without war in the World ...this near border Was old Bridge without Control
How much contraband was on that truck. Looks 50 thousand pounds overweight if that debris is what I think it is.
My prediction: Jeffery Sachs will blame the Americans.
"When ever Russia makes an accusation, its an confession"
"Gee, I wonder how that happened."
100% Cia-mi6
be careful because russia has nukes
Why dont you stop war
Slava Ukraini!
Russia got imaginate treting from Ukraine. Ukraine never wants Russian territory but putin are occupied Ukraine and not allowed Ukraine to be alone. Live Ukraine alone. Go and think about your Russian in your own country .😮😮😮😮😮
I wonder if Russian takes very sirios they killing Ukrainians children and civilians. Ukraine should be independent not putin demands what he want .nato country who in border to him not tread to Russia
"Good lord once with the BBC , and now look how desperate you have become reading their news stories."
Well and honestly presented. Good job
Ukraine is top of the list for NATO membership. Russia cannot demand an independant country not join NATO. The only reason for blocking NATO membership is to let Russia reinvade Ukraine again. So Nato non membership is non negotiable
"AL-JAZEERA is full of nut cases. Russian is using 38% of its Whole Economy to FURTHER THE WAR and KEEP IT GOING. THERE IS NO WAY ON EARTH the MAD PSYCHO KILLER DWARF from the KREMLIN is trying to STOP THE WAR or even NEGOTIATE ANYTHING. Any talk of a CASEFIRE or Negotiate an agreement is PURE NONSENSE. The KILLER PUTINs EGO DOES NOT ALLOW HM TO BACL DOWN OR SERIOSLY Negotiate ANYTHING. He has NEVER KEPT to ANY AGREEMENT, International or LOCALIZED in the LAST 25 YEARS. WHY WOULD HE CHANGE NOW???????????? GET REAL AL-JAZEERA. You simply back COMMUNISM AND DICTATORS EVERYDAY!"
"Within the next three months the ruble will completely collapse, hyperflation in Russia will go completely out of control , Russian oil buyers will be slapped with 500% tariffs and the Russian bank runs will initiate bank collapse in Russia, try and do your war then Russia, I dont think you can"
"USA office , Minister of Germany in USA , Weapons - Cars - Food - offices for paper in Germany or Valery Gerasimov (can kill)with Alfons Mais (can kill) in WELT TV?"
"So russia is asking what will it take to end the war? Dude, all you have to do is get out of somebody elses territory and go back to your home.Thats the end of it."
Russia demand is over board ....too much ..
Zelensky inviting bigger trouble for his people.
Balanced reporting? Well thats weird
Ukraine is Its on country. Russia has no business sticking It nose into Ukraines business.Mind your own business.
No one invited zelensky to attempt to k1ll putin while putin said that there will be negotiations to end the war F around and find out
Zelensky wont surrender until Ukraine is reduced the size of Portugal.
Glli americani devono aiutare gli aggressori ...
"Non e vero.--i, russi hanno solo lingue ma non i fatti"
"There is no peaceful end to this war now despite govt truces, theres been too many deaths leaving alot of civillians on both sides wanting revenge and will seek it regardless of a peace agreement... this is now a fight until the death..."
Zelensky still believes in he could defeat Russia.God bless.
In Zelenskis war Drone are Strikes Technology...wars System....and Russie is Technology....Vanguard ...together Iran
Lurvlov is dreaming in the broadday
They tried to assassinate the president of Russia. Now the gloves are off......uraaaaaaaa
U.S. couldnt fight a war for more than 6 months against China or Russia. Conscription would break E.U. apart. If held throughout E.U. Western debt is becoming meaningless.
"Someone tell Hillary Clinton that its not 1998, not even 2008 anymore. As time goes on, Western nations debt rises, while power decreases. Bush and Clinton have ruined this country. Obama couldnt save it, and Trump will cement the problems."
Ukraine sent drones to Russia the west and trump doesnt call comedian zelensky crazy
Missiles talking for themselves as zelensky once said
Mighty Russia
Russia is soundly winning this proxy war instigated by the US in 2014.
This is unbiased new reporting . Thank you aljazeera
There is zero peace push whatsoever.
Putin terorist
May as well be RT. joke journalism
A very pro Russian perspective. Good to know where Qatar stands.
Talking about piece doesnt mean piece has come
"When Russia responds, the media and the west start crying."
It took you guys so long to admit that Ukraine had send so many drones into Russia that led to retaliation
Did Porko shenko declare war on the CHILDREN of the Political Opposition in Donbas (Oct 2014)? He is on PUBLIC VIDEO koprofage.
"679 drones in 24 hours coming from Ukraine , not 1 hit its target. NATO proxy armies will never learn. defeated in iraq Afghanistan , while another sits in the borders of syria, protecting Israel, should iraq grow a pair and kick the west out"
"By US/EU standards, Russia’s strikes are remarkably precise —minimal civilian casualties despite the large number of drones and missiles fired. If America were attacked like Russia was, their response would’ve been far more brutal under ANY president.Russia’s ’s response is measured, proportional, and unemotional.Ukraine’s air defenses are gone. NATO is tapped out. Zelensky is now sacrificing his entire nation to avoid political (or literal) death."
Good luck &amp best wishes Russian forces
Russia has the right to defend itself
West is always initiator and perpetrator of wars - this war by Zelensky is no surprise
russia and israel are competing for the title &quotThe Best Fascist of the 21st Century.&quot
Despite US efforts the war continues
What does weaponization mean
"Stop quoting Allah..Tell Allah to come in Gaza and help children.Stop this religious nonsense.Be human first.Show sympathy towards others and their beliefs, then they reciprocate the same with you and your beliefa"
Muscovites are such a
How are Ukrainian cities a military zone... fake guys
Never-ending war
Woow putin is going forward
Trumps tweets are not mediation...
"Allahs Apostle said, I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror &lt&lt Sahih Bukhari 2977 &gt&gt"
"o Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them &lt&lt Quran 9:73 &gt&gt"
"Before the arms industry, take care of the children of women who are homeless! The people who pay you!!!! And you are doing so well."
"US is in a proxy war with Russia (Rubio admitted this) and is supplying ALL the munitions, armor and intelligence, etc. to Ukraine. Did Trump seriously thought that just telling some flatteries about Russia and Putin will make Russians stop its offensive? He must be very naive.Russians had already laid out conditions for a ceasefire and the West just ignored them. Now the Russians will force the west to admit defeat on the battlefield. Putin knows that he holds all the trump cards (pan intended)😊."
"It’s a joke, he sends weapons in to attack Palestinians - does he not know about the attacks on Russia? Who is keeping him dis informed?"
"You trump,,,,,what about Israel ? Huh.....useless leader I have ever seen"
"MR TRUMP says one day GOOD and another day he says BAD.Hope he is more stable in giving his opinions.He is exactly like ALJAZEERA news channel.Not stable in reporting and very agenda driven.Look at how they report INDIA vs PAK conflict.Always baised towards pakistan just because of religion and nothing else.They support banana republic like pakistan ruled by ARMY who funds terror rather than worlds biggest and largest DEMOCRACY India...End of the day in todays times,every country and every news channel is baised towards their own benefits and nothing else..There is no true and good journalism left in the world.Muslim news channels support muslim nations even though they are rogues,same goes to christian or jewish or hindu or buddhist or communist news channels.Does AL Jazeera really have these qualities.100% BIG NO....&quotAdhere to the journalistic values of honesty, courage, fairness, balance, independence, credibility, and diversity, giving no priority to commercial or political over professional considerations.&quot"
Hypocrisy of stupid old man trump. How about Israels genocide in GAZA?
"The joke is, he is complicit in a genocide in Palestine and he allows himself to open his mouth start cleaning in front of your door, big pig."
"They play cat and mouse while children are bombed, they are both cowardly vulgar, inhumane, and disgusting beings. Putin needs to be removed and be gone, as has Traitor Trump. A real POTUS would have stopped Putin by now."
But you like netanhayu despite he do worse than putin! Hypocrite
"I would like to say He’s the worst hypocrite we have today, but he’s just the most blatant. Most western leaders are just like Trump, hence the genocide in Gaza. Free Palestine ❣️🇵🇸🕊️"
He dont like what Putin is doing but he dont see what Bibi is doing. Is he a one eyed man
Whos donald trump?.
"Trump lost all credibillity when he talked about Gaza as if was just a real estate deal ,"
Hypocrite Donald and USA only sees putin not Israel
&quot Hes doing it apparently cos he thinks hes winning&quot. So does everybody else
Ttump still aint got the msg
Why you are not barking about Ghaza killings while both are condemnable
"If Putin is crazy, then Trump and netanyahu are absolutely NUTS and kaputs. They need to be put in the Gotham nut house immediately gor killing babies."
You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist - Gandhi
Putin
Incredible that they only mention Ukraines massive drone attack at the last few seconds and thats it.
Trump just realised he is a mere spectator in this affair...
End war
The end of the war
For putin to stop attacking shows weakness and thats not going to happen. This war will only end when Russia decides its over. To think otherwise is foolish.
Philistines have no ledars left. Why is no one seeing them especially Europe
"Pakistan 🇵🇰 is the sponsor, trainer, exporter and safe heaven of all forms of Global Terrorism. Pakistan is mothership of all forms of Terrorism.Pakistan is a Terrorist country. Indias Operation Sindoor was a preemptive act of self defence."
Netanyahu aka Miliekowsky is not &quotabsolutely crazy&quot though. Why not like it? You can go take over Ukraine and build your resorts there instead of Gaza.
A mouse criticizing a lion. Putin could not care less about anything the imbecilic Trump thinks or says.
"Putin is defending his people as far as I can tell. After all, Russia gas a right to defend itself. I suppose only the chosen people have a right to defend themselves."
"Everyone supports their Ally nation ,he is not hypocrite, he is human"
"Trump:I called him friend, then I called him crazy, then I called him best friend.&quot"
Trump is crazy lmao seeing him crying is actually hilarious cos how much of a hypocrite he is omg
How can this man speak this way when it was they who wanted to destroy Russia 🇷🇺. Now Russia is defending themselves he is crying foul. Why not stop giving Ukraine weapons so that the war can stop and do the same for gaza. Come on come out of your ivory house and face up to your wrongs around the world 🌎
wow! the senile orange idiot is so brave!
Wĥo is Mad?!! I dont think so to say Putin may be the one who rape the capital Hall !!¡
Stop war
PUTIN TRUMP
"How about Gaza when Netanyaho is doing air strikes, you also knew him since long Mr President? why this double standard"
Putler is not crazy. Vladorf Putler is a bandit and a murderer.
Donald Trump does not support war which is a great sign
Putin is actually very kind person thats why he has not used nuke against Ukraine.Always supports Russia whatever happens with us in India.WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF SANCTOINS.🇮🇳🌹🇷🇺
The war will be over in 24 hours!
Mr Trump you dont like the way Mr Putin is doing at all but you you like.What netanyahu is doing at all right What is the difference?
My Question is what is Netanyahu killing if Putin is killing People?
Israel is continuously firing bombs in Gaza every 3rd day after multiple ceasefire violations. Where is his tone there?
But he supports Netanyahu killing civilians with American bombs
Well Trump should check if Netenyahu allows him to speak like this in the first place. He might get in trouble..
"Mr. President,I do understand that you are not happy with Putin, BUT what I do not understand is: How could you be happy with the Israeli prim minister...???"
Why are you not saying anything about gaza
&quot Ill end that war in one day if I get elected &quotDonald Trump -2024
Putin is fed fing up!! He wants a peace deal now!! Ukraine shoots off drones constantly. Russia has won this operation!
"Trump himself is guilty of bombardment, Trump currently bomb Yemen houthis"
"Putin doesnt lies if he said he will punch you, he will definitely punch you,"
"Thats not helping, Donald."
right but too late
"Disgusting, demented, Stupid president Adolph-Vladimir Donald Trump! A reckless, greed-driven Trump, fueled by corruption &amp an insatiable thirst for power, is spiraling out of control—dangerously resembling a dictator, trampling over laws &amp citizens alike in his relentless pursuit of self-interest. Most Americans, exhausted &amp fed up, just want him gone for good."
American citizen Are very stupid like trump
Did Trump believe Putin is a reasonable politician? Or this is just Turmps lip service to prove hes not Putins secret asset?
while he keeps his mouth shutdown against israel genocide
"Trump complaining about Putin, is like a guy who’s trying to rape a girl and is complaining that she is defending herself we know who started this conflict and why."
"He is stupid. He only sees killings in Ukraine, white Africans killings in South Africa, but he doesnt see civilians genocide in the occupied Palestinian territory, Gaza. He has given full hands free to the Zionist apartheid regime. That is their hypocrisy that people dont care about whats Russia doing in Ukraine."
"You Rascal Trump do you like ,what Your baby Rascal Nitenyahoo is doing?"
Hi aljazeera i tell you one ting can you tell trump he dont like kill in ukraine but he like kill in gaza now haha this is duble trump can you ask trump
Russia is targeting Hamas underground tunnels and bunkers.
Trump should also talk about the killings of Palestinians
"This world is corrupt because this world are run by bunch of clowns and wolves , but not for long! Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon,Repent, believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again"
Didn’t you say 24 hours what a joke.
"I am maga. Just stay out of it Trump. Zelensky wants war, let Putin handle business"
Let the West leave Africa alone Mr Trump
"Trump is 1 speech away from The United States throwing everything into it. He has that much power here. There is no Country on the planet that can stand toe to toe against The USA military. It is not National arrogance it is real world fact. The capability and technology is the gold standard. That’s what he plays with at this point , when he can just steal the land he has now and end it. Fool will lose everything. He cant get his regime off suicide hill."
So many comments left by Hamas here. Qatar?
"I would say great job to Putin. Trump can have his supporters in 1 speech agree to give Ukraine full blown military aid. That means the most advanced war planes , drones , ai , military satellite networks , long range missiles , long range artillery , patriot systems , naval craft , the list goes on and on. All it takes is for Trump to give his supporters 1 speech Putin and the entire United States will be on board to throw the entire of The United States into the war effort for Ukraine. Putin is going to force it."
This is one of russians war. This country cant live without attacking its neighbours.
Trump missed the road. Why keeps quite about Israel genocide against Gaza?
like natanyahu. To condemn is nothing.Else Gaza would have been free by now.
And then give it like a couple of weeks later he’s on Putin’s nuts after I don’t believe anything that comes out of this orange man’s mouth
Trump will end Ukraine war on DAY ONE??? LOL
US has no say on Russia
"On the same day, 12 killed in Ukraine and 30 killed in Gaza, but somehow Putin is crazy but Netanyahu is sober. US for you."
"Obviously Putin hasn’t paid tribute to Trump. Just as obvious Trump doesn’t care AT ALL about bombing innocent people… otherwise he’d be very upset, very Bigly upset and Gaza. But see, the Israelis have paid. So, just as obvious he doesn’t care about that silliness anymore."
"Well then, he still hasnt called him a war criminal or terrorist. He wont do anything."
Trump a complete disappointment for me.
Wish Trump would not like what Netanyahu and his murderous Henchmen are doing to the women and children in Gaza!!!
Pretty sure that you all know exactly what it will take for this war to end!!!!! Same thing in gaza!!!! Unconditional surrender!!!!!
"Funny, nobody calls Zelensky crazy, when Ukrainian Nazis attack Moscow, or launch a terror attack against Moscow.On the other hand, almost all Democrats and half of all Republicans call Trump crazy."
"I dont like what you are doing, Donald! Funding a T organization, I$I$ for trying to frame muslim being an evil religious."
A blatant display of selective outrage—condemning one aggressor for their crimes while defending and excusing another perpetrator of genocide. Such hypocrisy and bias are revolting.
Wake-up F trump stupid talking BS and rubbish everyday oceans of lies.
Wake-up F lady are you ignorant person like hell..you need to address President Putin not by name stupid lady..This fakes news channels now become toxic USA gangsters group
"Mr. Trump no talking like you guys did not talking about Libya, iraq, affghanistan. Just send no1 world troops in Ukraine. Sanctions are jokes now and everyone laughing at you. They got 75 trillion resources."
No-one knows crazy like the Orange Oompah-loompah.
Trump killing innocent people in Gaza in thousands. shame on him
"So Putin is killing a lot of people, what is Netanyahu doing!!"
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 Free the world SMFH. Free All 54 Nations In Africa
"It is widely understood that the United States plays a significant role in the Ukraine–Russia conflict. For Russia, Ukraine’s potential NATO membership has been considered a strategic red line since at least 2008, as evidenced by earlier tensions such as those in Georgia. Russia appears prepared for a potentially prolonged conflict—comparable in historical terms to the Russo-Swedish wars, some of which spanned over two decades and resulted in territorial shifts. As noted by representatives such as those from the Russian delegation in Istanbul, the key question now is whether Western nations can continue to support Ukraine at increasing economic cost, especially as BRICS nations strengthen their economic partnerships and China advances toward its strategic milestones for 2025 and 2049. Peace"
"Yea, and Trump, just as Biden did, is sending hundreds of billions of dollars in military equipment to Ukraine used to kill Russians, plus Ukraine and Israel are both on national welfare programs paid for with U.S. deficit dollars. Neither Israel nor Ukraine can support a viable war footing economy. And, it was Ukraine sending hundreds of drones into Russia on Thursday nite to kill Russian civilians. Both Genocide Joe Biden and Genocide Don, the Trump, exhibit mental problems, no matter if it be dementia or an even more serious problem. They are both insane."
Putin is crazy but Netanyahu and Trump are not?
Now this idiot has signed a mineral deal so all of a sudden he has mouth
This foolish guy care about of people somewhere while allowing killing of others somewhere WHAT A JOKE White supremacist racist
Didnt rump promise to end the war on day one?
He finally gets it. Stable genius at work!
The definition of a senile delusional hypocrite. Nobody cares about you and your thoughts mr trump
The British Hegemony and its servile MSM desperately hanging on to every tiny noise signal form their mutinous US Colony.
"Reported in the Kiev Independent - For at least two days in a row (20th May-22nd May), Ukraine has launched massive waves of drones deep into Russian territory.According to the Russian military, 159 drones were destroyed 22nd May. The ministry said Ukrainian drones had been intercepted across multiple western and central regions including Moscow where 22 drones were reportedly shot down. The surrounding regions of Kursk, Oryol, Tula and others also came under attack. The reported wave of drone attacks follows a broader trend that has intensified in recent months."
&quotJust sign this contract! Security garanties come later!&quot
Zelensk attacked Putin in Kursk visit then Putin retaliated then people say Putin killing people
What about zelensky’s drone attack??
He doesnt like what Putin is doing but he supported what Israel is doing too Palestinian
A crazy calling another crazy ! . Does he say the same about Shitanyahu ????
Mr۔trump۔you۔like۔esraeil۔bombing۔over۔gaza۔
It takes one to know one.
So what about the Putin association attempt..... This is just the beginning....
Vladimir Putin
"The media bias on this issue is overwhelming. Ukraine recently launched hundreds of drones into Russian territory—why isnt that making headlines? How exactly was Russia expected to respond? With flowers and kind words? Naturally, they retaliated with force. That’s how conflicts work.Yet, the media seems determined to only tell one side of the story. Now theyre in a frenzy because Trump made a critical remark about Russia, hoping it will somehow trigger the harsh sanctions or punitive measures theyve been pushing for all along. But let’s be real: that strategy isn’t going to work. Russia is committed to its course."
Hypocrite leaders So Palestine 🇵🇸 theyre not human right Hypocrite Arab Arabs hope youre seeing
Russias number one goal is getting NATO out of its borders. By the tone of this story Putin doesnt seem to be the only one who &quotthinks hes winning&quot btw.
Ukraine 🇺🇦 in trouble
Al Jazeera works for the CIA indirectly
And the hypocrite will not condemn the strike on Gaza.
"Trump criticizes Zelensky, stating his words cause problems and should stop."
United States upset because Russia is not falling for their trick
America has no moral justification anywhere after allow the carnage in Gaza.
Karma is coming in russia
Welcome to Phalistein...Trump the donkey manArab rulers are real culprits
"This man is more concerned about Putin bombing Ukraine and killing people may be 100 in a month. But he is not bothered about Gaza where Israel is bombing hospitals, schools, houses, blocking humanitarian aid. The bombing did not stop during His visit to KSA, UAE and Qatar. This is nothing but double standard of US president. This man is loud mouth and no match to Putin."
The united snake you have no moral to criticized Russia
When we compared Russia with Zionist Russia is mother Teresa
Remember Trump pulled out Netenyahoos chair to sit down. Israel is the puppet master
Putin knows that Trump is a joker.Why did Trump trust that Putin will end hostility in Ukraine?
What about the childrens in Gaza being assassinated by Israel what about Palestinians peoples seems like America cannot talk to no one anymore losing its grip the world is into a time bomb
"Putin is the Hitler of the 21st century, and he is ready to kill millions of people to conquer neighboring countries. Now the new Hitler is seizing territories of neighboring states. In 2008 he seized part of Georgia, in 2014 he seized Crimea in Ukraine, and in 2022 he decided to seize more territory in Ukraine. Trump can go down in history as Roosevelt (helping democratic countries fight an aggressor and profiting from it by selling weapons), or he can go down in history as Chamberlain, signing peace on Hitlers terms and provoking him into new wars.."
"Trump should equip Ukraine with the necessary military weapons to stop Putins rockets and missiles, and stop making empty rhetoric against Putin."
so what are you going to do TRUMPIE
Ukraine is mostly Zionist people.
Putin laughing at Trump!! Do not tell me what to do.
"Russia has only killed 12 people by accident and the whole western world is ablaze. The US, UK, Germany and many NATO countries are supplying weapons to Netanyahu who is killing an average of 120 unarmed women, men and children in Gaza. Daily. Who is Trump to condemn Russia? Who is listening to this nonsense?"
"To Russia, Trump and the US are ants at a picnic. An annoyance that is easily dismissed."
Netanjahu and trump kill more innocent people than Putin
"Presidet Putin its not armi generol hi its Presiden hi dasint have nating to do with the wore the Generals in rashen armi ar responsibal, Tramp it ignorent are stupid?"
I seem to remember after the announcement of Russias initial invasion Donnie McFelony called Putin a Genious
Trump is a buffoon balloon pumped up with ego... as thick as a brick with the smarts of a 12 year old.... but I have to admit I was pleased to hear trumps apparent realisation that hes been played like a fool. What will trump do about it?
Trump never condemn Israel attack on civilians in Palestine
Shame he doesnt say the same about Netanyahu... he's even crazier!
He should say that to n yahu?
Putin is like Ok Donald you dont like it. Do something about it then
"Zelensky (with the help of the CIA, etc.) had attempted to attack Putins helicopter on a flight to Kursk. Mr. Putin, of course, wont stand for that... The CIA operates 20 offices within Ukraine. Why? To escalate the situation?"
How are all of these wars still going on... ANYWHERE...! What is this worlds damage?
"Continue to play with Mr Putin, you will understand when the time comes that Putin doesnt understand weakness but strength."
I’m don’t like it at all but we’ve been good friends for a long time.
Trump doesnt have the cards
If u call putin crazy what u call n yahu??????
"They are all crazy, each wants to be a dictator and Trump wants property for developments."
Unfair from US pres. not called Netanyahu crazy killing innocent people children. Wake Muslim ummah
Why he didnt condemn Ukraine for attacking Moscow the day before.
Trump said he was in that war in 24 hours.He could have told the president of Ukraine to withdraw his troops and surrender to the victor day one and no one else would have needed to die.
Uncle Sam you are a disgrace nobody believes you.
Don’t fall into trumps gimmick playing double game. Watch few days ago he will praise Putin and criticise zelensky
Lol maybe don’t give the guy concessions if you’re trying to do a peace deal. I get this guy is America first but surely he realizes each day Putin makes him look weak on the international stage. Xi is watching
So its absolutely fine if Ukraine fires bombs on Russia with drones but president Putin is a maniac if he fires on Ukraine? HYPOCRITES!
Trump you are stupid
Nothing but more US hypocrisy on display.
"Why Trump didnt condemn the Israeli genocide on the Palestinian people fkr more than eight decades?Trump is absolutely crazy, not Putin."
How Putin could be a Crazy man if he has just retaliated what the Ukranians had done to Russia for the strikes from the Ukranians so this is not logic condemnation.
Independent media is important.
Will he say that to Netanyahu ?
Treat people as you like to be treated it goes both ways you cant and will not get a way with every action and expect different reaction thats crazy.
Trump want them in Gaza
"What is Trump going to do about it? Exacly, nothing."
But he likes what Israel is doing. Seriously how dumb do you have to be to vote this clown.
PM BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WENT CRAZY LONG TIME AGO
Allah is talking for Gaza
How many Russian hostages is ukraine currently holding?What date did ukraine invade Russia 🇷🇺 before putin declared war on ukraine?Islamic terrorism has no place in this era of civilisation.
I dont like it at all wa wa wa
"This isnt about the Palestinian people its about Russia and Ukraine. Lets stay on topic here. Ukraine sent a lot of drones to Russia, and they responded sure its sad on both sides. I JUST pray that this war would stop and not drag the world into war for 3rd time"
Putin is doing nothing more than than what you probably still doing in yemen
But hes happy with The ZIONIST JEW OLE NUTTYAHU and hes ok with seizing Palestine and letting The Israel ZIONIST CONTINUE TO GENOCIDE ??? PUTIN IS NOT A PUPPET LIKE THOSE IN AMERICA AND THE WEST ...PUTIN SAID HIS TAKE ON THE GENOCIDE MONTHS AGO
But no criticism of Ukraine attacking Moscow. Hypocrite. Russia has the right to defend itself.
He is crazy!! Killing people! Stop it!!
Who the heck is Orange man to even open his mouth against Mr Putin? This orange man is equally involved in the Palestine Genocide shame on this terrorist with tiny hands and no brains
Trump is crazy why he dont condem our brother Muslim in gaza
WHAT ABOUT CRITICISING THE OTHER CRAZY RUSSIAN BENJAMIN NETANYAHU THEN…
Russia has the right to defend its country from nazis
"Hello, Pentagon, does it still cost 1 million for the best anti drone weapon per fire/launch? Hope not."
A crazy person calling someone crazy... seems kinda crazy...
"Condemnation is not enough, trump with empty words. After such killing n you are only considering but not decided sanctions. He cant yell putin to better stop the missiles, but rather, zelensky should shut up."
What about Benjamin natanyau is he crazy?
Trump is a RACIST WAR CRIMINAL!! People burning alive &amp starving in Gaza!!!! Speak to your bff satanyahoo!!!
Fake news Putin is better than you
Ukraine is funded and armed by NATO to wage war for NATO interests. But Palestine has nothing and still getting butchered. West is silent about Palestine. Hypocrites
Russia China North Korea and Iran have the right to defend themselves and Taiwan is a Chinese province.
"First say the same thing to Netanyahu, you cow dung head"
Well president Trump give Ukraine what they need to strike with in Russia to stop the missile attacks.
"Who cares what potus like, he will not say thesame about the genocide in Gaza."
Why is con arts trump even getting involved Russia Ukraine conflict!? No one voted for that! Thats not even his war. Trump is mentally cooked!
The one easy way to know if you are controlled is knowing who you cant criticise...Israel
The number of women and children were killed in Ukraine is not comparable with the number killed in Gaza.
donald dump the chump
"Putin is bombing cities so that the so-called &quotWestern democracies&quot will give weapons and money to the Zelensky-Poroshenko regime, and so that the war will continue as long as possible. 1. The longer the war, the better the Russian army will be improved. 2. The longer the war, the more Russian-speaking people from the frontline regions will move to the west of Ukraine, which will allow the Russification of all of Ukraine. Everything is according to the plan of a special military operation. The US does not take into account the fact that Zelensky is an agent of the Kremlin. An example of Zelensky being a Kremlin agent is the &quotKursk operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine&quot, which was planned in the Kremlin even before 2021. &quotThe proof is the television appearance in 2021 by Russian politician Zhirinovsky,&quot in which he reported on the future capture of a small part of Russia for some time by Ukrainians at one of the stages of the future war, which was to begin, according to him, on February 24, 2022. Zhirinovsky knew exactly when a full-scale war would begin, and about the operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Russian territory. He was not a prophet, he was closely connected with the plans of the FSB. In 2024, the Armed Forces of Ukraine hopelessly entered the territory of Russia, capturing 1/6 of the Kursk region, which proves that Zelensky is an executor of the Kremlins will and a puppet of the FSB. With its acting, the Zelensky-Poroshenko regime has turned Ukrainians into obedient executors of the Kremlins will. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are used only as a sparring partner for the Russian army to improve it at the &quotterritorial integrity&quot training ground, without the right to win, and the Zelensky-Poroshenko regime manages to ensure constant supplies of manpower to the training ground. Americans, by sponsoring the Zelensky-Poroshenko regime, you are sponsoring the genocide of the Ukrainian population. The problem is not with Putin, but with the fact that the so-called &quotWestern democracies&quot have turned a blind eye to the rule of international law, which is based on the UN Charter and UN declarations signed after World War II by countries that wanted world war to never happen again. The war in Ukraine is not Putins fault, but the unwillingness of &quotWestern democracies&quot to understand the causes of the war. 1. Self-determination of peoples is a legitimate norm (UN Charter), especially after the overthrow of the constitutional order in Ukraine on February 22, 2014. 2. The &quotDeclaration on Principles of International Law&quot does not deny the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Ukraine to protect self-determined republics. Ukraine is not Yugoslavia, but the recognition by the world community of the fact that Ukraine has disintegrated just as Yugoslavia once did will stop the suffering of the people (Ukrainians) and end the war, but for the so-called &quotWestern democracies&quot only business is above all else."
What about israel? Who cares who about your like and dislikes.
Hypocrite trump
"Trump, Poutine, Israélien s PM are all &quotout of control&quot!!!"
&quotAbsolutely crazy&quot to Putin while Trump funding a T organization I$I$ for trying to frame muslim being a evil religious.
"What do you think is happening in Gaza, Mr. president?"
"Trump has criticized Netanyahu, search it... Geeze he has publically stated he doesnt like Netanyahu even 2 years ago"
Haaaaaaaahaaaaaa someone should welcome trump from the trump world into the real world
"But, by tomorrow Trump will again be saying nice things about Putin."
What about Sudan and Myanmar?
And when the US funds a genocide thats not crazy!
"Who trust a person in the White House who had said, I CAN STOP THE WAR IN UKRAINE IN 24 HOUR Not Russia and China."
"Donald Trump should condemn isreal for committing genocide in palistine,Thats if Donald trump was not involved in the genocide himself."
Takes one to know one!
A massive attack at a command centre resulting in 12 casualties is &quotabsolutely crazy&quot. But attacks on schools with children and at least 100 casualties a day is business as usual for the USA.
"Want USA PEACE in Ukraine ?No, USA and the West World only want minirals and have control over the natural resources in Ukraine."
What about Netanyahu he is happy with him
But he doesn’t mind Netanyahu doing the same as putin. Such a BS
Whats D.Trump think and say about the WAR and KILLING in the Middle East and Gaza ?
"so something about it then....seems like that comment if his is forces by media, he doesnt mean anything thou..no usual claims on what he is gonna do...just for the media. cheap"
Trump got played hard
So no mention of Ukraine provoking Russia by attacking thousands of drones 4 days in row yet the clown is playing victim yet Trump is too dumb to understand anything to be honest
Trump did not talk abaut 600 dron attack in moskov and did not talk abaut isael attack in gaza
Hypocrisy at it highest
"&quotThey call it a tragedy when 12 to 14 people die, but turn a blind eye to the daily massacre in Gaza. The world is obsessed with Ukraine, yet silent on Palestine. Maybe Putin’s just giving them a taste of the justice and equity they preach.&quot"
First start by stopping netanyahu
"Who cares what Trump thinks, a pathological liar ."
He doesnt like Putin for bombing cities and at the same time sending more weapons to Israel to bomb hospitals and schools? Cant take that seriously I guess.
"If you dont like it then stop the sending of weapons to ukraine to prolong the war.Trumps talk one way his action runs the other way in opposite diection, who is he trying to kid."
Do u like Palestinians getting killed u are just a good example of a double standard person try to be Human and sincere in your life
But not Zoolensky? Russia only responded to the drone strikes Ukraine sent 2 days b4 that? This is war is he supposed to let his small neighbor attack amd not do anything back? What aboit Netanyahu? Gaza strip is gone. Rubble and the ratio of civilian deaths is higher....That silence is why the west isnt took seriously anymkre. The world is watching this hypocrisy
I hope war stop clear by dialogues and thats will be better for both country after they are brought peace love
"BS, the war is between the US and Russia. Is the US going to stop supplying Missiles to Ukraine, like Israel could not have lasted a Month, without the US !!!"
Ukraine make mistake I think
Double standards and hypocrisy in full colour.
How slow and speed do you have to be to understand Putins actions.. dear Lord. Trump is being played by Putin!!!!!! OMG! Dumb Trump.
Trump is right
Trump with his daily dose of mini bullshit stories that keep his leather face on the front pages.
Trump should learn the lesson engage brain before mouth !
"Trump change his minde every day now ,No body cares what he says ,LOL"
"What about Ukraine 🇺🇦 send rockets to Moscow, where is his comments on that??"
"american zionist trash unhappy their war against russian freedom is failing as afu, nato faciists are defeated"
Does Trump really think that Putin cares about Trump thinks? Is he as delusional as Zelensky???
Who condemns Trump for striking Yemen 🇾🇪 every day?
Hey go again
Aljazeera you are all just a bully. Keep spreading your news we all know. Don’t you pretend to know the reason why Russia launched that attack. Putin went to Kursk and the Ukrianian drone was launch at him assuming it’s trump am sure Ukraine will have turned to dust by now but guess what that launch is just the tips of an iceberg. Kviv will be unlivable cos you have no idea you are just sitting here deliberating
Putin is his dad.... Trump cant threat putin....
"Mr Trump, this is appalling, but far worse are the izreali CRIMES THAT YOU CAN STOP. Change your advisers"
"Well, Mr Trump should condemn Natos advisory to Ukraine, coalition of the willing for supplying arms."
"Oh really, well was this before or after Ukraines barrage of drone attacks almost killing Putin during his Kursk visit-yeah, nah-Putin’s not crazy-let’s hear the facts!!! BTW Trump should be mad at Zelensky he’s the real culprit here!!!"
Does he like it when this happens to The Holy Land we call pal east ine?
Trump is afraid of Putin my big brother gadafi did nothing when all of them join together to kill him ..till date Libya has no president..now there are all enemy to each other.
"Media with their twist of words.., where did he say Putin has absolutely gone crazy?"
"He should be telling that to Netanyahu, who is really mass-murdering children and women"
"People dont forget ... February 24, 2022: Russia invaded Ukraine. -&gt Russia violated international law"
Go into Russia and take him trump
What did they expect from Russia America normalizes genocide they stand up for people committing genocide of course Putin is gonna take advantage of their coward against Palestinian people
Only an idiot can negotiate with a terrorist.
"Yep he likes to talk about russia, but Isreal bombing Civilians who dont have any AA defense. Ukraine does. Im sick of hearing about ukraine, also sick of this media playing both sides. Israel isnt a problem bombing gaza, but somehow russia is a problem. Biggest joke in history are these media networks."
Netanyahu is absolutely crazy for creating the Gaza holocaust
For who are not able to sleep during the night seeing attacks in Ukraine just close your eye and think this is happening in Gaza and people dying are Palestinians.
How you support Israeli occupation in philistine everyday killing more than 100 how you support Israel you dont support President Putin?
If Putin is crazy what about Netanyahu
Netanyahu is not crazy and Mr. President Putin is crazy
"Zelensky told Trump this in the Oval Office. Trump kept saying that this was not his war, but he is the president of America now and his indifference and comments will not stop the war, if he does nothing and does not stop being afraid, then there is still a chance to fix something, if not, then Trump will be a historical mistake of the Americans who voted for him."
So he doesnt like putin killing but its ok for bibi ?
Hypocrisy at its best
Putin ‘ okay media star . Aren’t you still supporting with whatever &amp supplying weapon’s everything needed to destroy my co
Russian missiles are speaking for themselves. Stop sending weapons to cause death and destruction in Gaza.
"How about you Dump, enabling the Genocide of the Palestinians, the Holocaust of the 21st century!!!! You are the worst of the worst! Just past night more than 50 people burned to crisp in Gazan school turned into shelter. Go look at the images of the parts of children by your American bombs!!!! You are the epitome of Terror!!! Do not moralize around!!!!"
Putin is the only white who thinks bruin and black.Long live king PUTIN!
Wow. Really?
"Shame on this idiot, should be ashamed with netanyahu too"
"It is imperative that this lunatic be removed from office, otherwise he risks dragging the United States of America into ruin."
SHAME ON YOU MR PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP
"A round of applause for The Trump. After 126 days in power, hes finally said something true. Its like watching a toddler learn to how to eat spaghetti, but not as fun."
"Ukraine doesn't want to be Russian, it wants to be European. Anything Russian says is garbage!!!"
I think it was only 12 ..but this hypocrite doesnt see people killed in Gaza..
Can’t take his word serous anymore
"Si Trump quisiera, podría detener a Putin y a Netanyahu en un momento . Todo Europa le apoyaría!!"
"If Putin is crazy, that means Netanyahu is Satanic"
"Trump doesnt dare to condemn Israil since one year killing innocent people,while Hamas doesnt attack innocent people of Israel"
Zel is a Krack head.
What about bb
Trump is no diplomat. This war will be decided on the battlefield
Trump is either brain dead or unhinged.
"Narrated `Aisha:The Prophet continued for such-and-such period imagining that he has slept (had sexual relations) with his wives, and in fact he did not. One day he said, to me, &quotO `Aisha! Allah has instructed me regarding a matter about which I had asked Him. There came to me two men, one of them sat near my feet and the other near my head. The one near my feet, asked the one near my head (pointing at me), What is wrong with this man? The latter replied, He is under the effect of magic. &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 6063 &gt&gt"
"As the US caused this war has funded it with its allies - cauaed 1,5 million Ukrainians dead not to mention Russians and then the injured - US has lost ANOTHER WAR with its allies - Trump walk away!"
Narrated Aisha: Once the Prophet was bewitched so that he began to imagine that he had done a thing which in fact he had not done. &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 3175
Happy to find out Russia in Action. Things are moving fast.
Ukraine fired 1200 drones at Russian positions this week. Russia now responded.
"Donald Trump condemns Russian strikes on Ukraine, calls Putin absolutely crazy while the US is supporting israels genocide of the palestinians, Total hypocracy"
How about the when he said hell finish the war in one day? Is he still in his first day
At first Trump stops Israeli genocides as well as weaponizing Ukraine. Then come to talk about Russia. Idiot.
lmao ... Hes killing a lot of people? Like Netanyahu?
lol but you like Israel sending rockets to Gaza.
He’s been played
"Netanyahu however hasnt gone nuts and sick after burning civilians alive in Gaza, right?"
"Now he doesn’t like it, but he kisses the feet of"
"Kievs regime could easily avoid it, if signed the peace agreement, proposed recently in Istanbul. So, there is no one to blame, but Zelensky."
“I’ll end the war in 1 day”
"Why Trump is quiet in Palestinian killing, he has no power but controlled by Israel."
Russia has the right to defend itself from Ukrainian drones.
Free Palestine
And Tr@mp you and your friends is**l bombing on child and hospital staff.and u not giving any response to stop this in Gaza is****l
Cap with Make America great again is made in China

Trump is talking about the killing people. .I think hes not human being Gaza Genocide.

Because Condemning things really makes a difference!?
"This is war, isnt genocide. what happened in Gaza?. Trumpet."
We condom trump
"What about gaza,?hypocrites"
Tell the same to nutinyahu
"When will USA Trump condemn, Netanyahu over Gaza."
Israel is 6 million times more cruel than Putin.
what about Isreal Trump killing women and children. No mention typical.
"Killing white Europeans is unacceptable to Trump. White Europeans supposedly being persecuted in South Africa, and he offers them refuge in the USA. White European Israelis being held is unacceptable to Trump. Yet murdering Palestinians is acceptable. Sanctions against Black Africans is acceptable. The patters here is Trump the racist runs US foreign policy based on skin color."
"Putin was doing the same thing when rump berated president Zelenskyy in the Whitehouse , and has been doing it for over 3 years! So why all of a sudden he doesn’t like it ? He was too busy putting on a show for the cameras instead of offering empathy and support for president Zelenskyy. Such a sad man"
"And yet he works as a buttler for the butcher Benjamin, This orange man doesnt have any humanity left in him thats why hes the saddest loneliest person on the planet."
YET YOY LIKE NETANYAHU?
Kyiv was the first
I dont like it how innocent woman and children are slain in Palestine stop that first
The situation in Gaza is hundreds of times worse than Ukraine and the US itself is involved in it but there is no discussion about it.
"America has always played the game of,We will nomb you, But , please dont fight back , or defend yourselves."
But his friends in izrahell is killing animals right? Sad world
Did he condemn israeli Genocide in Gaza۔۔
"Trump should realize that if russia folds, Iran and the Houtiis will follow quickly."
This is face hypocrisy
trump blind and deaf on gaza massacare and alert on people kill in ukraine
"Ukraine fired 1200 drones at Russia, Russia has the right to self defence."
What about Ukraine trying to kill Putin while he visited Kursk ?
What about Netanyahu your idiot
Ukraine doesnt want Russia as his neighbour
And what about the killings of Palestinians waddy Chaudhry
i no longer take TRump serious his a Hypocrite. Why dont he say that to israel war on gaza.
Is there a fact over the fact that the Ukrainians trying to assassinating Putine bye trying to shoot his helicopter down using drones at the same time when one calls another crazy one has to have sound mind and conducting oneself in a healthy mental manner. May God keep us all safe with such leaders running the world affairs.
"Ukraine use schools and civilian areas to hide weapons and military bases , Russia has good intel from Russian speaking citizens who supports Russia. They give the Co ordinates and destroy these military hubs. All the while Ukraine shelling civilian areas of Moscow. Nobody mentions Gaza which is 10 times worst."
Putler gone wild
Trump you are not eligible to condemn this
Thank God Trump is normal
"What about u bombing Gaza Mr Trump??Well it’s totally all ur bms/jets doing the jobs,, and ur country silencing dissent?????HYPOCRITE!!!"
Hypocrite donald trump
"He, thats the partner of Ishraels crime, he that murders the people and their children in Gaza. And is just sending USA Neo Nazis to Gaza, under the cover &quotaid&quot to complete the annihilation of Gaza and its population. Arrest warrant should have been issued since long against him❗"
Putin didnt start this war for profit by the zionist usual suspects and the carnival barker Trump doesnt even make the cut as a the man Mr. Putin and the great Russian people are.
Says the man who wants to remove all the Palestinians so as he can build his Middle East Riviera.
Hehe he said I will stop the war even the day before I got in to white house hah
How about trump says the same thing about Netenyahoo ?
Trump is absolutely crazy
"When Ukraine Stops sending Drones to Russia, I’m pretty sure They will stop sending them into Ukraine."
I would imagine Putin thinks Trump is crazy for killing hundreds of thousands of people in Palestine. Putin is much saner than Trump.
And here you see President Trump solving the Ukraine war.
Ok sir what about gaza please can tell me
Putin doesnt like NATO having an American Base in his neighbours garden
Putin laughing at Trump
"You dont like the killings by Putin but support,like and aid the worst genocide by Netanyahu. Double standard"
Who is he to criticize Putin??
Trump is becoming hypocrite and double standard. When Isreali is killing babies every minute he never said anything about it
Putin is a Maniac. Hes not human
"Mr. Trump, if you dont have guts to condemn Israel doing massive murder in Gaza then keep your mouth shut here also"
"Free free philistine ,May Allah protect the people of Palestine."
Hypocrite is exactly whats on my mind.
Wish Trump had said that he didn’t like it at all
Free free philistine
The one who sees money in a corpse
TRUMP ALWAYS DUMB.... DUMBER... DUMBEST...
Rusi hoće sta je njihovo.
What about Gaza?? In the world all are human being...?
Free Free philistine
Shut up trump! What about your puppet Netanyahu?
Ooo mr trump thought that putin would stop for him how funny
and Donald Trump is stup*d clown
"Al Jazeera When you show Gaza you stand firmly on the side of victims. When you show Ukraine, you give space to russian murderers so that they could talk about their genocide in “positive” way like it was nothing wrong in carpet bombing civilians. Shame on you."
The media never shows people suffering or gore! The war community approves of the slow info! More defense contracts!
"Every time there is prisoners exchange, there are also deaths that follows &quotlives for lives&quot so sad"
Always more money...
Ukraine asked for it and Russia is still exercising restraint.
This while Kanal 13 channel reports otherwise that Ukraine is winning and Russia is collapsing. This channel is an insult to Ukrainians and youtube.
"That my friend, is a mighty bear. NATO underestimated Russias fire power. A paper tiger with boy scouts from 32 countries. Be very careful."
"ADJAZEERA TV HOST ,,GO &amp SEARCH FOR A FLUENT RUSSIANS ENGLISH LANGUAGE SPEAKER STOP PLAYING POLITICS WITH RUSSIANS. YOU ONLY BROUGHT THIS MAN ON SHOW TO HUMINIZED THE RUSSIANS. DOUBLE STANDARD . BIAS ..ADJAZEERA CHANNEL IS BRITISH GOVT/ GULF NEWS NETWORKS TV STATION ,HELP YOUR DEFENDLESS &amp HELPLESS &amp ARMLESS PALESTINIANS ( GENOCIDES ) STOP YOUR DOUBLE DIRTY GAMES .THATS WHY ADJAZEERA TV BANNED BY YOUR ARAB BROTHER EGYPT 🇪🇬 HELP PALESTINE 🇵🇸 NOT UKRAINE OK"
"Of course the illegitimate, fake, US/EU installed Ukraine puppet, Zelensky, will claim all the Russian attacks were easily neutralized while at the same time peeing himself while snorting a line of coke to calm himself. Trump is no doubt reaching for the phone to tell President Putin to stop, then calling the drunk at the Pentagon, Hegseth, to send more bombs, missiles, intelligence, and troops (mercenaries) to help the Ukraine coke head, and then calling Netanyahu and urging him to bomb more women, babies and children in Gaza. Of course, in the Oval Office Trump accused S. Africa of human rights violations."
"WHEN UKRAINE 🇺🇦 ATTACKS ON RUSSIA 🇷🇺 WITH WESTERN SUPPLIED DEADLY WEAPONS ,YOU GUYS HAPPY &amp PRAISED ZELENSKY GOVT. BUT ,RUSSIA 🇷🇺 HIT BACK YOU FAKE WAR MONGER PROPAGANDA MAINSTREAM- ADJAZEERA, BBC,SKY NEWS, CNN ,NBC FOX FRANCE 24, DW .. ANTI RUSSIA 🇷🇺 PROPAGANDA CHANNELS ."
The Russians really need to get better people to represent their position.This guy just keeps stuttering and lying.
No condemnation from Trump as usual
Zelenskyy is a supporter of the ongoing genocide in Gaza? Aren't you ashamed?
The amount of russian bots in the comments is just evidence of the desperarion of the russians because they know they are losing this war. Thank you. Slava Ukraini!
Go RUSSIA go ORESHNIK
So what? AJ has a problem with this? Qatar and AJ must be so blindsided to think the world allying with the west is going to help them. Ok with the Palestine reporting but that is a ploy and all other talks are such propaganda.................qatar really thinks they a fly in this world?
"i see, you promote israeli and russian drones?!? How much profits you got on sale?!? Any good?!, dont think so, check the real beast on channel : EngineerReact"
Zelensky zelensky in psychiatric hospital
The massive Antonov factory near Kiev has been totally destroyed.
Drug man
🇯🇲 Zelensky wants the Prisoners to fight war -- I bet alot of them are refusing to go back.
Animals attacking children
"Man it’s sad all these news outlets sold out and to see Al Jazeera a so called Muslim channel that only Russia been defending Palestine and they lying and giving biased news it’s just disgraceful smh, no mention of Russian cities and civilians being bombed by Ukraine missiles and drones but will make it like Russia is attacking for no reason"
free Palestine stop genocide
Is Aljazeera an arab or western media ?
"Its not an intensification of the Russian attack, its a response to the NATO attack from Ukraine against Russian territory with 340 drones and missiles launched by Zelensky five days earlier."
Zelensky is a rat. Sacrificed Ukrainians for what?
"If russia killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than israel killed Palestinian children, does that mean that russia is four times less fascist than israel?"
very good
Russians bots dont have heart. They are zombies.

"Why is Aljazeera show only the videos of the Ukrainian POWs? Is it because you are afraid the world is going to see that Ukraine held elderly people it took hostage from Kusk region? You people are pathetic hiding the truth from the world. Thank God for the internet, you no longer have monopoly in this space."
Al Jazeera double standard
Western countries must stop Instigate this war. Ukrainians and Russians are the same people. This war could not happen if it wasnt for the western countries especially Britain and France. They are benefiting from this war.
I’m not sure what was harder to listen to her propaganda trying to act like Ukraine still has a fighting chance like they are really doing some damage or the guys accent and inability to finish a sentence
the ukrainians returning smiles =))). do they know that they will soon be sent to the front again?

White on White crime to Bad !!
Heat is turning up
The nonsense western narrative is being destroyed before our eyes and yet the fools leading our countries double down on a daily basis....
The little green action figure Zelensky plays his part to a T.........Really good comedian. So sad that Ukraine is about to collapse as a country. The end is nigh.
What about the children in Gaza?
Zelinsky will put them back on the front lines with in 2 weeks.
"Who is controlling/ advising zelensk?..does zelensk have power in Ukraine? Why cant he say , we stop firing insider Russia, and Russia stop firing insider Ukraine! But zelensk is busy sending drones in 100s inside Russia, why?"
"Russia, China, North Korea and Iran have the right to defend themselves"
It’s going to get worse every day
"You people are evil, because zelensky is a comedian he cant think for himself, youre deceiving him for Russia slaughter house"
The idea Americana is Ukrainians make good engineers and academics. They are waiting to begin a partnership that builds.
Zelenskey causes all of this to.
"Green T-Shirt thought he was invited for a lunch at the E.U. and NATO table, not realising that Ukraine was the menu."
Why do soldiers hide in the bunkers and leave children outsideEverytime I hear children died but never heard about Azov soldiers
Nonsense this 1st Journalist is out of touch. Scraping the the surface with news. I feel he is tpp leaned to Kiev
"So, didnt go well Ukraine 1000 drone attacks toward Moscow. Now Russians retaliate, who would think."
Prisoners just being escorted
So where is this month of suspension?
AlJ?
"Tell military loss and the Ukrainian military industry complex that Russia struck, you are always hiding truth on the ground."
Compare the russian PoWs returning from Ukraine with the Ukrainian PoWs returning from Russia.It showes you everything you need to know about the war.
Its was amazing in this 21 century to wickness how a comedian was dupe into a war with a country 20 times bigger than his

When israelis return to their Ukrainian Ancestral Colonial Homeland THE WAR WILL END.
donOLD Tramp SOLD milaniyah to Vladimir
Immidiate secondary sanctions for countrys who by Russian oil
Trump is &quotweary&quotHe simply wants Russia to win and bring it all to an end
"He is lying, like he always does. Putin agreed to nothing, no ceasefire, nothing. I guess this is the kind of &quotreporting&quot from Al Jazeera we can expect now Qatar are buying off Trump with airplanes."
Great
The Galizian junta can always withdraw to their native Galizia and stop cosplaying as &quotUkrainians&quot. It really is THAT simple. Western Media is pretending like history started 2022.
"If the United States stops supporting the war in Ukraine, Ukraine will make the first proposal and a ceasefire agreement will be signed within a month."
Thats all that needs be said!
Putin is a smart man. He sees that Trump is a clown like everyone else. Plus he has the video with Trump and the prostitute that peed on him. So he has all the cards!
Bullshit
He meant…eventually
Fake Putin is a look alike!! I hope the real Putin catches them !!
Turkey always disappoints as mediator.
I expect nothing.And i will probably still be disappointed
"when theyre sayll peace and safety, suddenly, coming destruction.Times over, the midnight is here."
🇪🇺 under Russian .kudos putin .deal with it perpendicularly
Trumps voice is an empty sound for Putin.
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
"i just called to say, I love you.I just called, to say how much I care Secretly the bestest of friends ruining the world"
putin SHOULD NOT NEGOTIATE WITH trump. putin should HAVE THE BALLS TO FACE his European counterparts. putin should FACE A UNITED EUROPE and NOT AVOID THEM.
It will be end when the fundings end
"Europe offers nothing except sanction, why would Russia want to deal with Europe?"
If putler can ask Ukraine land in peace talk then nethanyahu also demand Gaza part in part of peace plan
"To achieve a lasting ceasefire Zelensky needs to step down. New elections need to be held. Ukraine leadership needs to sign a neutrality agreement with Russia. Ukraine was officially neutral from 1991 in an agreement with Russia until the Ukrainian parliament voted out neutrality in Dec. 2014. There was no Russia &amp Ukraine war before 2014. The war was provoked from the many years of U.S./CIA meddling in Ukrainian politics, which is against the U.N. Charter. There is hard evidence that in 2013 the U.S/CIA was training Ukraine opposition groups to illegally overthrow the Ukrainian government in early 2014. Also, the constant push of the U.S. to get Nato missile bases in Russias border countries."
THE UNITED STATES STARTED ALL THIS WITH THE COUP BY NULAN
I wonder where will this peace come from especially when Ms. Von der Lyon speaks about peace......after all she said and did now she will call for peace...whats happening....?The best that can happen is to take Zelensky out of the way and save the innocent remaining Ukrainians....if not...One Day we will wake up with a new name of ukraine as Ukrussia when Zelensky and co...has already dissapear for good...
That bus is pure propaganda the bus was in an area near the fightingwere civilians shouldnt be found. Europe is not looking for peace all its actions show interference and a desire to keep it going enhancing the narrative it is looking to rearm and is buying time.
"Once Russia stops fighting, nothing they requested will be honored.The West will continue to send weapons, NATO troops will enter Ukraine under some excuse, seized Russian assets will not be returned,and more sanctions will be imposed.For Ukraine ceasefire is a win, because frozen conflict gives them time to regroup,rearm,rest,recuperate,reorganize,recruit more soldiers and dig trenches, not to mention that Russia would lose all the momentum and therefore initiative.Russia agreed to unconditional 30 day ceasefire if Ukrainians withdraw from the four Regions ( Oblast) , Ukrainians refused.Russia agreed to unconditional 30 day ceasefire if the West stops sending weapons and satellite images, Ukrainians refused.What is basically going on is, the WEST is trying to reverse losses on the battlefield at the negotiating table, and they are trying to win during peace what they could not win during war."
"media you wanna help to stop the war: then show real business(real reality) of 2 sides in war, you show one side, losing people and building, another side is what?! Enjoying and powerful, so obviously you dont like the war to stop, actually you support Russia or just like wars, cos media has more jobs and money alobg. Just if you tell reality, will be enough, for media i mean. Russia didnt gain anything with war, actually lost a lot, the same as Ukraine, you show Ukraine enough and real, i dont need to talk here, Russia lost many soldiers, war equipment, even blind can see this, on parade in Moscow were almost nothing of weapons to show, cos is all destroyed, i have to check UA news and videos of UA drones to see what exactly is going on, for example EngineerReact channel, there are many more,.... no you dont want to stop the war, actually you like it, thats real news!!!! Meanwhile dead body of both sides every day, .....You and other west media want to hide Russia losses i know then where your mind going."
Qatar gifted $400 million jet to trump... More on this plz al Jazeera
Amazing. You people lie so much and so often that what is clear is YOUR own belief in all those lies. The West now lives completely in a wonderland of magical thinking.
Ukraine 🇺🇦
"Trump would give Putin ANYTHING he asked for in terms of Ukraine, in order to get financial deals for America!! Ukraine cannot trust Trump."
"Once Ukraine is completely destroyed, the &quotpartners&quot will be looking for the next proxy and Ukraine will be forgotten. By that time not sure how much of Ukraine will be left. &quotPartners&quot have been mischievously causing trouble for Russia and claiming they are peace lovers when in fact they are trouble makers. They were already in talks 3 years ago, until the european partners arrived and destroyed ukraine. Ukraines problems are not Russia but the EU, the real peaceful world can see this and EU propaganda will not work this time as information is available freely on the internet to compare EU BS."
Usual russian communist trolls in the comments section.
Ukraine should surrender but won’t so Russia will take the whole country.
It is the West that is prolonging the war and the killing. The stupidity of the Ukrainians are being exploited by the West for their own greed.
Sanctions on node stream 2 that is already blown up hahaha whaat!!
This is a biased program. Pathetic journalism.
For the last 100 years Europe has been imposing new and new sanctions on Russia but really it is working ....
"to be honest... EU and US just admit and sign a delcaration sumbit &quot NO NATO Membership, NO EU membership for ukraine &quot it may start the ceasefire and eventually peace truce... You guys had tried everything from sanctions to arming ukraine. but this diplomacy you guys havent try it. maybe it works."
"Russia returns 909 dead Ukraine soldiers while Ukraine returned 36 dead Russian soldiers. The kill ratio is over <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN59pM-HQt8&ampt=87"">1:27</a>"
&quotHow to achieve a lasting ceasefire&quot? Remove the major obstacle - sapienti sat.
Why invite the Russian guest if you are going to interrupt him in the middle of answering your questions?
"The best thing is for Ukraine to surrender and accept all Russian terms, Zalensky to go to jail and Ukrainian remaing territory to be built"
EU commission is the main barrier to peace process..
Its a shame that not much of critical thinking is going on. Dont you find it the strike strange? The strike is awfully suspicious cos thats a target ghst Russia doesnt hit and why after the two sides are negotiating... Clearly someone doesnt want negotiations to succeed. Anx lets not forget the recent past when bodies were staged on streets to potray a fake story that was later exposed at the UN as fake srory by Ukrainians. I am not saying its the Ukrainians or Russians who struck but it is possible that someone in the system doesnt eant this to settle history shows its most likely form the western side than eastern
"Ukraine has no cards, so they cant dictate terms. End of story."
the host is a pc of scrap. interupted! this woman has no self-respect.
"The intro gave us partial information about the exchange of dead bodies. Russia returned 909 bodies to Ukraine while Russia got 34. Given the often quoted casualty figures it seems as if Russia does more to preserve it dead Ukrainian soldiers than Ukraine. Or is this an indicator of the the kill ratio? In which case it makes sense that the intro did a half disclosure of the exchange ratio.Further searches show that the April exchange was 909:41, and 909:43 in March."
Why does she interrupt the guest on one side but does not on the other? It is sad. Listen to both sides and then ask questions. That is why journalists such as Tucker Curlson and others are succeeding where the mainstream media like this one are declining.
Putler doesnt want peace . Putler wants the whole of Ukraine and a bunch of other countries. Wake the f up
The Russian expert is very carefully sends a message on just how ridiculous Putins demands are. He doesnt want to get in trouble
"Ukrainians fight for democracy, independance, freedom. Palestinians fight for ISIS state"
Just keep fighting for your land Ukraine. NATO knows about putlers plans. Stay strong. 3days he said lol.
"Both, peace and Power play so super power dear to invade and bully inferior countries."
"Ukraine ceased to exist as an independent state long ago, Peter, long ago."
This is nothing compared to a genocide happening is Palestine ofcourse we feel for the families and those going through this but at least Ukraine can defend itself gaza is being killed by hunger now
You want peace but aggravate by sanctions. doesnt von de liar realise sanctions aint working. And alot of eu nations still rely on oil and gas from Russia
"Z bought Blinkens plan, and now he has to go."
Sanctions on Nord Stream 1 and 2? Would you invite Americans to destroy the remaining pipes?
False flag claims on missile hitting civilians.How come theres aoldiers in uniforms there
With US money
This channel is and always been a Western propaganda main stream media
"If you mean will the drone strike hamper peace talks, that is up to Ukraine. They have never been a position to dictate terms of peace or even peace talks. Putin never said HE would go to Istanbul. More sanctions Ha Ha Ha. Like that is going to make him surrender. Z and Europe keep harping about a ceasefire. They want this to ream and reorganize their troops and positions. Only a fool would agree to allow the enemy to gain strength and Russia is no fool. The EU doesnt want peace. They are heading towards WWIII with their attitudes."
Russia is going to use nuclear
santions Russia is not dependant on anyone. Do not make us to lough
I think EU doesnt have cojones to support Ukraine with her full might
"Stop interrupting your guest, please!!!!"
Russia options: peace or fighting fighting will let them to more land Ukraine options: peace or fighting peace will give Ukraine more land now how got a better option? Ukraine want Russia returning all their land...LOL...they are still dreaming and unreasonable.
"Trump knows that Iran is lying and yet continues to make agreements with them when every child knows that Iran already has several nuclear bombs and not just one or two. Trump is lying to the whole world and misleading the public. The only question I have is the reason for these lies. Isnt that what he promised Putin not to harm Iran and at the expense of the whole world, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, that you continue to believe him? Theres no need to wait until Monday. Putin and Trump talk on the phone almost every day. Only idiots still dont understand this. On Monday, it will be a call for publicity from all the ovaries that are not intended for publicity. Its time to understand and grasp this. Is Trump more Russian than Putin or does Putin have something we dont know and is he managing to blackmail Trump?"
"No, you will not reach a ceasefire. Russia has military leverage and Ukraine through the US/EU has leverage via sanctions. For Russia to give up its leverage then the US/EU would have to drop sanctions. Neither side will voluntarily disadvantage themselves during peace talks as it would be foolish."
"Sanction will not help, Zelensky is not experienced politician just continues acting on other orders . Could have prevented this war , but did not . His resignation would resolve this situation"
"The problem with the peace talks is that Ukraine is losing in the battlefield but wants to negotiate from a position of strength. This delusional thinking is fuelled by EU countries which are talking big but doing little to bolster Ukraines strength in the battlefield. If they think that Putin is the modern-day Hitler, why dont they send troops to Ukraine to fight him?"
"is it still the position of Ukraine, that the oblasts already part of russia by law of russia, be voluntarily returned to Ukraine.`? Military option of re-seizing them, seeing what happened in Kursk to the ukraiinian surge, looks a mirage shot."
But Western media has been telling us that Russia has run out munitions.
"The war wont stop unless Putin runs out of troops or money and he seems quite willing to suffer another million casualties if the Kremlin believes they can win on the battlefield. (Which is clearly not going to happen). So, only through the most severe sanctions can the West bankrupt Russia and end Putins reckless ambitions."
Zelen is getting old …
Fake news platform
NATO allied to USA pushed the expanssions to the frontiers to Russian Federations. Former retired administration officials poured in money weapons to help Ukeraine caught grilled on fires blazing inside its own border. Whose faults is this saga ?
"I think Putin needs to take all of the Ukraine, then all these Stupid people would really have something to Cry about !!!"
Russia will end this war militarily doesn’t matter how long and how hard it is! Zelensky wasted 3 years fighting instead of negotiating!? Russia shouldn’t leave it to the next generation to fight and there won’t be a second chance for Russia. If I am Putin this is what I will do!!?
"Qoute, &quot To be an American enemy is dangerous to be an allied a fatality. &quot Dr. Henry Kissinger decades later this statement true in Ukeraine case false for Israel the Zionist Masianics xenophobic worshiped in the western system."
"This is all BS !!! Putin has had experience dealing with these people before, he doesnt want the same thing to happen like Minsk 1 and Minsk 2, a 30 day ceasefire will only give the Ukraine a chance to re-arm it forces, Putin isnt stupid, you shouldnt listen to dictator silensky, hes the one that has prolonged this War because he changed the Law blocking any contact with Moscow, truly a Clown, he should have signed the original documents and saved nearly one and a half million men from dying, but he was making to much money 💰 💰 💰"
"Russia still at war or on their SMO against Ukraine,innocent people will be killed in any war as we see it all the time.Ukraine will loose more territories every day in delaying this,next time it would be 8 territories.United state is not responsible fir Russians.Remember USA politician who publicly said “ best money ever spent on killing Russians is supplying weapons to Kyiv”."
we want peace ... so were working on the next set of sanctions this cracked me up
“Help Gaza. Every dollar counts. Donate now—link in the description.”
Did this guy seriously just go on International television and say that the Russian president doesn’t have authority??? He’s literally the only one with authority. He’s a absolute dictator. What a joke.
Lol look what you created Europe. In Ukraine. No wonder you want Russia to just take Ukraine and be done with it.
"Russian casualties are low he knows it ,just clever propaganda"
"This is a war between NATO.. including the US and Russia..using Ukraine as a proxy..the headline should be..&quothow to get a lasting peace between NATO and Russia&quot.. answer..stop threatening to destroy, break up Russia and steal its resources.. simple"
The advancing army picks up the dead. Ukraine only knows how many died by the number of men who dont return.
"Firstly, the news of return of 909 fallen Ukrainian soldiers is incomplete: it was not unilateral, but rather in exchange for 34 fallen Russian soldiers.Secondly, the choice of the Russian and Ukrainian panelists is weird, they both are good for a freak show, both speak total rubbish."
Simple accept putin term of ceasefire or wait for humiliated defeat nothing can stop Russians whole western money weapon only for delayed the result
"Yeah, unconditional surrender is the only practical solution for Ukraine at this point. Hitlers Germany also refused to admit defeat until Hitler killed himself, then Keitel signed unconditional surrender. Post war settlement is Russias business."

Dear Russia im your big fan so plz dont kill innocent people
Over 9 people in that little van? On the line of contact?

What civilians doing in Russian border state Sumi
Ukraine has had no problem killing their own civilian so far... still at it I see
Israel does this to Red Cross vehicles all the time. Not a PEEP. Almost like your fomenting something . Edit: Love the pic. NO SIGN OF BURN/ HEAT from an explosion. The paint not even cooked. WTF
It was probably a Ukrainian missile. They have learnt a lot from the Idf cowards
They are foreign armed men
"People familiar with pictures of drone strikes would see immediately see that the damage would be much worse since Russians use their drones to destroy tanks, armoured vehicles and heavy machinery."
Why near the border with no license plate?
Passenger bus??? Yea right
"Civilian bus near Frontline in the middle of war? Lol, remember zelensky is a comedian,"
"If this was a lancet drone the bus will be in pieces, this is false flag"
It was carrying mercenaries No Doubt.
"When Russia says Russia wants peace, what they mean is they want a piece of Ukraine."
The amount of mental backflips the Al Jazeera viewers have to do from watching a video in Gaza saying targeting civilians is bad then to seeing Ukrainian civilians being killed and saying it’s their own fault We are so cooked as a human race

If there were civilians.... We would see them because Ukr loves PR. NONE in the footage. Why? All qe have is an accusation amd/or narrative.
Thats not a bus and Ukraine army used civilian vehicle also the lowest payload of lancet is 1 kg of explosive
"now al jazeera begins to show mainstream media and corporate journalist practice, you keep saying civillian bus but you provide ZERO proof the victims are actually civilians."
"If it were a Russian drone, the condition would be worse. Even the tank was destroyed."

&quotcivilian bus&quot near frontline (around 4 mi)? and why &quotcivilian bus&quot with no license plate? its foolish propaganda from Al Jazeera
Al Jazeera fans supports this because they think Putin is an Angel
At least its not a red cross vehicle or an ambulance
Really? Reporting not convincing total bias
Does attacks on innocent civilians look like Russia wants peace to you. Russia is a terrorist state….
Its a strike by Ukraine not Russia. I can sell you me.
"909 Ukrainian bodies for what you didnt report - 34 Russian bodies.Tells you something about the true casualties occurring in this conflict. Up to One million dead Ukrainians and up to 150,000 Russians. Bit of a difference ?? Try reporting the truth Al Jazeera"
This is zelensky sabbotaging peace talks
"Western mainstream media propaganda at its best. No mention whatsoever of continuous Ukrainian strikes on civilians schools, hospitals, public markets, city centers, civilian vehicles......the list goes on. More importantly why not report on the root causes of the conflict ?? Why dont you report the truth Al Jazeera ??"
Al Jazeera becoming more and more western mouthpieces especially American.They have pushed Genocide in Gaza further down list of reporting.
Do people relise that when drones are shot down or electronically shut down that the drone drops out of the sky its going to come down and cause damage so when either side claims civilians were targeted i would take it with a pinch of salt
Ukr propaganda
"The Messenger of Allah said: “Whichever woman dies while her husband is pleased with her, then she enters Paradise.” &lt&lt Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1161 &gt&gt"
"Narrated Anas bin Malik: We were (in the funeral procession) of one of the daughters of the Prophet and he was sitting by the side of the grave. I saw his eyes shedding tears. He said, &quotIs there anyone among you who did not have sexual relations with his wife last night?&quot Abu Talha replied in the affirmative. And so the Prophet told him to get down in the grave. And so he got down in her grave. &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 1285 &gt&gt"
PutIer
They also swopped the dead. Just over 900 Ukrainians for 46 Russians
turkiye slowly become regional power
well if both delegates are satisfied with the results of the negotiations than its a win/win
"☪ Chapter: It is permissible to have with a female captive after it is established that she is not pregnant, and if she has a husband, then her marriage is annulled when she is captured They took captives (women ) on the day of Autas who had their husbands. They were afraid (to have with them) when this verse was revealed:&quot And women already married except those whom you right hands possess&quot &lt&lt Sahih Muslim 1456d &gt&gt"
Ummmm Ukraine and Russia do prisoner swaps all the time so basically they got nothing done. smh fools. No more jet rides for you all. take a train back to America. lol
"Turkey cant even stop its neighbour hitting inocent lives, and here they came for peace against both strong armies"
Ukrainians are actually better off without Zelenskiy.
Next time Ukrainians should vote better president that understand geopolitics and not a comedian
Well done turkiye
"As always, Starmer and Macron, unhappy with the course of the negotiations, are probably already gritting their teeth in anger and soothing themselves with сolombian miracle powder."
"US June debt interest payment coming.....the printing money machine starts revving up.....Ukraine soldiers now busy digging rare earth to pay Trump for the earlier weapon deliveries, now Ukraine soldiers really picking the shovels"
"The war is just too long already, both side is exhausted, please give mercy and blessings for the one who suffers through this conflict, and may be peace upon them."
"The US has lost its last triple-A credit score from a major ratings firm after being downgraded to Aa1 by Moodys, which cited growing federal debt."
"I was wondering why Zelensky acting like that since the beginning , it all blow my face after cocaine scandals"
Boris Johnson is a presidents Ukraine vs Peace to visit Ukraine
but you are losing. Say the truth instead of the propaganda
"Ukrainian President Zelensky faces mounting internal turmoil as his government unravels. With military leaders and key advisers distancing themselves, his recent decision to engage in direct talks with Putin, without a ceasefire, is seen as a desperate surrender. Behind closed doors, Zelenskys inability to unite his leadership team is fueling fears of a political collapse. As Ukraine braces for potential negotiations, the once-sturdy resistance is showing cracks, and the fate of the war hangs in the balance."
French and Uk people must be commended for sacrificing their pensions to help buy the billions of Euros of weapons desparately needed by the suffering people of Ukraine
"Russia was duped in Minsk 1, Minsk 2 and Istanbul 1. Now is the time for Russia to dupe the west. Russia will not be fooled again. Russia had enough of 3 failed negotiations. The conflict will be decided in the battlefield. And the reality is Russia is winning the war so why would they agree to a ceasefire. Just common sense."
This dudes backdrop is fire
Russia has agreed to cease fire then breaks the agreement. Every time. Glad they exchange prisoners.
Se ci andava portava Novichok...kolato per tutti.
Nice mobster outfit a black shirt
While Zelensky is going around the world for unproductive propaganda meetings Russia has appointed the most ruthless General to grind Ukraine ground forces for next 3 years. Ukraine intelligence confirmed that this General was killed by them few years ago. Russia will finish this war militarily doesn’t matter how long and how hard it is! Zelensky wasted 3 years fighting this war instead of negotiating!? Russia shouldn’t leave it to the next generation to fight. There won’t be a second chance for Russia. If I am Putin this is what I will do!!?
A side ZELENSKY blackmailin president putin and other side side peace with president putin is not possible. Zelensky EU WEST-NATO SHOULD ACCEPT REALITY FOR PREVAILING PEACE
"Defence minister of ukraine has to First answer why Zelensky Threatened President Putin through EU WEST-NATO COUNTRIES, IF HE WANTS PEACE. PEACE IS POSSIBLE AFTER ZELENSKY EU WEST-NATO FAILED IN WAR AND IF AGAIN THREATENING PRESIDENT PUTIN"
Now Its clear more than ever that the US is not interested in peace neither in Ukraine nor in Asia. When Trump said he would end the War in 24 hours the whole World believed him coz that is quite possible coz the US is biggest sponsor and architect of this War.
"Just like Zelensky, Hitler also begged and cried for ceasefire before his defeat.History is repeating itself."
"Al Jazeera should have also reported what the Russians had said, not only what the Ukrainians said. I agree with Russia that we need a permanent solution, a temporary ceasefire is of little use other than giving time to accumulate more weapons for the next attack."
"Gli ucraini sono bravi perché studiosi infatti parlano englesi, invece i russi non ci fanno capire parlano solomente la loro lingua"
Ukraine wants Ceasefire to rearm and for rest to it’s soldiers
"Ru bots are out in big numbers today. Whats wrong, are you afraid of losing your 3 day SMO after only 3 years? Glory to Ukraine!"
"NATO is trying to set up a trap for Putin. They dont peace, they want to rule and dominate. Show the Russians some respect. The West started this war, and I am glad the Russians have shown restraint."
Americans dont want to pay one more dime for Ukraine.
"From the beginning, this 30-day ceasefire was not about gaining peace, but about using it to rearm and organize the Ukrainian armed forces."
"As long as the politicians of this world are not able to bring about a ceasefire and provide supplies for the people of Gaza 🇵🇸, as far as I'm concerned, Ukraine and Russia can continue to bomb each other endlessly."
The Qatari government should take action to alleviate the hunger of the people of Gaza.
Turkey
The Qatari government should try to protect the people of Gaza.
"When a clown enters the palace, the clown does not become a prince, and the palace turns into a circus!"
"Peace in the world, now! We are tired of our fellow humans dying in the name of religion, minerals, oil, greed and outright genocide. We demand PEACE for all nations and all people!"
"When a meeting is constantly filled with belches, farts and coughs every time one side begins to speak - the polite thing to do is quietly leave and allow the other side to gain control of their bowels and mouths."
"After all this destraction it will take 100 years for Ukraine to heal, and 50 for Russia."
“Ukraine wants peace” yet refuses to uphold 2022 negotiations they signed instead proceeded to ban all negotiations with Russia
That defense minister is too busy selling weapons in the black market. He is a liar and a thief.
Quite sad how people are underestimating the Russian negotiation team. Like did y’all ever research who they are? Not to mention the strategic reasons why Presidents aren’t present during negotiations.
Ukraine always quick to grab any media attention they can get
Another Jew?
"Everyone talks about peace, but they also want war... Ive heard something about Gaza, Mr. American?.."
"I think the Ukrainians live in a parallel universe they actually went to a peace conference in Switzerland without the Russians, The one country that could have solved the problem wasn’t there, that’s just a sad joke"
Al jazeejara @ All lies only
Nato failed Ukraine
"Wild how the narrative fell apart... the fog in the info war is clearing, people are hearing the other sides story"
Al Jazeera intentionally brings the most retarded guest to speak for Russia. He cant put 1 sentence together
&gt Blessed are the Peace Maker. &gt Mr.Putin there is no Gold medal in battle. &gtBut Peace makers will be called the sons of God and reward is in Heaven dont loose it
"The EU, Germany, Great Britain, France and Poland threatened Russia with new massive sanctions if Russia don`t accept an &quotunconditional 30 day ceasefire&quot. EU`s Ursula Von der Leyen, German Chancellor Merz, UK PM Keir Starmer, President Macron of France and Poland`s PM Donald Tusk tried to act tough towards Russia on Saturday. And failed miserably. They all should stop their pompous and undiplomatic Russia-related statements in my opinion. Trying to challenge President Putin in front of peace negotiations in Istanbul the way they did was plain stupidity from them. They should finally start to support President Trump`s negotiations about peace with Russia instead of making pompous threats and giving undiplomatic statements. That is if they want peace. Pompous threats seldom start the journey from war to peace. There are much better ways to start that journey in my opinion. Like clever traditional diplomacy, for example. President Trump did not join the European leaders pompous ultimatum they made to President Putin on Saturday about the 30 days unconditional ceasefire demand. Claiming that was a lie. He was neutral. There was a lot of fake news about President Trump and this issue in the media. President Biden called President Putin a dictator. President Trump treats President Putin with respect. Big difference. President Trump is the only Western leader who has had enough balls to show respect to President Putin. He has been attacked from all directions because of it. That respect is called for diplomacy. High time for similar respectful traditional diplomacy as President Trump uses towards Russia also for all the other Western leaders, in my opinion. That works best with the Russian mentality, so why not use it."
"Ceasefire, For what? The Ukrainians to re-arm.Think Russians are complete fools."
Zelensky is crazy for hoping russia will give him a chance to rebuild his clown army
Ukrainian plz take this comedian out of power his selling your country
"The negotiator is Putins advisor, he has Putin ear. Yet hes referred to as low level deligation. Thats cold."
So cynical.The fact that theyre talking to each other is a win for most spectators of this war.
Russia will not accept until and unless it gets some benefit.
Trump will want to divide up Ukraine
"Prophecy, Z is terminated...."
"Well, I just answered a question and got a sea of answers and a sea of likes and I cant get out of it and I cant answer everyone. Thank you. Oh yes, the question was what I would like to do or see before I die. My short answer was to see the death of Putin, Trump, and Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran and Netanyahu of Israel. I leave the rest to you because the world will be better after me. And since then, I have had no rest. By the way, the Europeans, as usual, have also remained hypocrites and toothless liars, no serious sanctions, and no actions on the ground."
"Russia was duped in Minsk 1, Minsk 2 and Istanbul 1. Now is the time for Russia to dupe the west. Russia will not be fooled again. Russia had enough of 3 failed negotiations. The conflict will be decided in the battlefield. And the reality is Russia is winning the war so why would they agree to a ceasefire."
"Trump: Hey boss, Putin: Shut up Im busy. Trump: yes boss."
While Zelensky is going around the world for unproductive propaganda meetings Russia has appointed the most ruthless General to grind Ukraine ground forces for next 3 years. Russia will finish this war militarily doesn’t matter how long and how hard it is! Zelensky wasted 3 years fighting this war instead of negotiating!? Russia shouldn’t leave it to the next generation to fight. There won’t be a second chance for Russia. If I am Putin this is what I will do!!?
"Russia just left open the door in order to save US face a bit, if they would be smart to use it, the probably very last time"
"What happens during and after the 30-day ceasefire? What is so special about this 30 days, Ukraine seem to want nothing but 30 days and only 30 days."
"Ukraine is dead, it was never a State."
Stay strong Pyotr. Ear muffs when this clown speaks
This old puppet clearly lost his strings. Detached.
"This is one of not so many channels that brings real news. Kudos. No trash talk, good and relatively balanced analysis"
"From the beginning, this 30-day ceasefire was not about gaining peace, but about using it to rearm and organize the Ukrainian armed forces."
Ukraine wants Ceasefire for Rearm and rest for it’s soldiers
"If Russia have to take the rest of the 4 Oblasts by force of arms, Russia will only demand Ukraines surrender. The terms of this surrender will be very hard."
Peter Zalmayev is someone who offers nothing to solve any of the root problems. Why have people like him on who simply promote destructive rhetoric.
"You see , this could have been a waste of time for Putin."
Is zelensky a comedian?
Peace (UK) or piece (RU) talks? Come on what a farce!
"And Zelensky himself has covardly left the talks, because he is not interested neither in negotiations no in Peace."
Russian position is strong
"Ukraine has already won this war, Biden told me"
Russia 🇷🇺 Already won love from Pakistan
Will al jazeera report the article in the Free Press by Frannie Block titled How Qatar Bought America? It lists politicians think tanks schools media outlets in the usa being bribed by qatar.
However ----It is good start.It is pre-process.Dont shock.Thanks.
Very funny in this 21 century to wickness how a comedian was dupe into a war with a country 20 times bigger than his.
"How goes the negotiations?&quotGreat --- we decided that, for the next time, theyre bringing the crumpets ... and were bringing the tea!&quot"
"Gilbert Brown probably has more intelligence crammed up his 300-lb. crack than the entire AJ staff, combined."
"When a clown enters the palace, the clown does not become a prince, and the palace turns into a circus!"
Yes he is ready to stop war then run and hide in UAE or Florida where he has bought palaces with American and European money.
"Good morning Zelenskey, no keep ot on, if am to suggest you may end up in jail for ur ignorance."
Zelensky must be jocking
he doesnt really want it to end. Dictatorship not democracy
Macron and Starmer will use сolombian powdered sugar again out of anger.
"This world is corrupt because this world are run by bunch of clowns and wolves , but not for long! Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon, Repent , believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again"
IMO the first step is Ukraine acknowledging how and why the war started
Why didnt zelensky take the peace deal that was offered to him months ago ?
Zelensky now wants to ends the war .. after he has done everything to continue it
He doesnt want to end the war. Hes doing what his masters in the EU and UK tell him to do.
Russia was trying to have peace talks long before the so btw.
Zelensky stop listening to Starmer hes just wasting your time.
It would have been better if you had gained wisdom earlier.
"Unfortunately Russia has no intention of an end to this senseless war.Putin is busy playing silly games,,he should grow up,literally."
"Wait for Zelya until the year 3000, the kitchen is completely frozen"
"He started the war, and now he wants to end it becuz he is scared he will lose the war"
Who is he. Russia is the country who has to dictate
Zelensky can not stop the war.
free Palestine
Zelensky out
The little Nazis Zelensky says end to war but but pushes for endless war. Get your Narrative right Al Jazeera
Every Accusation is an Admission. Wonder where he learned that?
His off shore accounts must be full along with the rest of the money laundering murderers.
"Ukraine wants to end the war because they’re losing,"
Is new world order imagine the losers want an condition ceasefire the western world we see the real face. Is the time to face the really
Undermine diplomacy
"And during this ceasefire, Europe would have a chance to catch up with production of military equipment ensuring that you are restocked for an attempt of retaking territory?"
EUA must be BOLD as Lion
Criminal Summit
The world stands with Russia🇷🇺
"Zelenskyy priority is remain in power. He need a ceasefire to , he isnt interested in Peace, as matter of fact he doesnt talk about Peace, he only say priority is ceasefire. He is the mouthpiece of UK,France, Germany, Poland and the Baltic nations. They still want to destroy Russia and in the process they are destroying ordinare EU citizens who are paying for all this nonsense"
"Dont worry about what happened in the past because I want to work for the police, I need to work for the police. I want to bring new ideas. I can not live like this and I can not die like this. What if I die?, what are you going to say?. Mistakes were made?. He was adamant to contact the police but unfortunately he died before we reacted?. Look. I. [Sigh]. I dont know what combination of words can stimulate a response because I have used them all and nothing works. I promise one hundred percent sure without atheism crime will drop. Lets put my claim to the test. Atheism and other fanaticism can end whenever you want. You choose, you decide why are you a police officer. Are you interested in eliminating crime?. The door is open and it has been always be open for police officers who are not interested in eliminating crime. Nobody is forced to be a police officer. My truth is atheism is a logical fallacy that assumes God is the religious idea of the creator of the creation to conclude wrongly no creator exists because a particular idea of God doesn’t exist. You have the power because you have the knowledge. Thank you."
Hell take his money..and run. Id like to see elections. I really thought Iran Israel . And ZIONIST would build Israel 4.0 Temple in Ukraine...
They want to end it when they are losing LOL
prison convict zelensky and blinken and nuland
"A reminder for americans, when the Soviet Union fell the Ukraine had over 200 nuclear weapons. They agreed to give up those nuclear weapons so long is America guaranteed to protect it. If America cant wait more than 4 years before betraying its word, why should Any Nation ever trust it?"
Putins a no-show... Id say Im shocked but Id be lying.
Shame on world humanity All eyes on GAZA

"Remembering History In the 1990s and early 2000s, Russia sold gas to Ukraine at a price of around $50. At the same time, Ukraine was reselling that same gas to Europe for 126–130 euros. By the most conservative estimates, this means that Russia effectively invested about $500 billion into Ukraine for free. But then three important friends came to Ukraine — the UK, Europe, and the USA. They patted Ukraine on the shoulder and said: “Let’s build NATO bases on your territory, let’s have you join NATO.” And from that moment on, the changes began…"
Its bollocks mate. Total and utter bollocks.
Not very historic. Putin totally snubbed zionist zelensky
"same thing will be agreed on as it was back in 2022, but after a puppet ended millions of lives"
Is it fair to say that Iraq and Syria should return to the hands of its natural governors unconditionally! I would like to come apart my waring brothers. It is obvious Russias peace conditions. No NATO military movement in Poland plusfree will relegation of Syria and Iraq!!!
Putin called the meeting but didnt show up himself. Does that mean Putin is saying no to peace? How much destruction does Russia want to bring to Ukraine?
"keep removing my comment, losers"
"Continuation of war doesnt stop peaceful negotiation... isreal was dropping bomb on gaza while negotiating , almost every pass war negotiations was done while war is going on. But why would Russia even agree to this 30 days, when ukraine cant even cease fire for 3 days?? They did everything to strike russia and gain grounds because they took advantage of this? Why would russia cease fire. As when they did their goodwill gesture to pull out of kyiv surrounding they where attack??Why should russia agree to 30 days cease fire when all ukraine and europe speaks about rearming and regrouping during this period, and for the coalition of the willing to send in NATO troops into ukraine??Can someone please tell me why????? For all who dont know, russia agrees with not just the 30 days cease fire but an forever cease fire, all its been asking is what are the guarantee that after the 30 dam days the war continues??????"
I hope PEACE prevail
Which idiot would believe that a resolve would come from initial negotion of this magnitude with 2 parties whoes request are so far apart???? And this is the very reason why heads of state dont meet at initial stages of negotiations.
So why havent ukraine met with the Russian negotiators??. They are meeting with everybody else except russia Clown show lead by a comedian clown
Ukraine has been droping bombs and drones during Trumps proposed ceasefire and AJ news never mentions Ukraines massacre in Kursk and Donbas!
"Is anyone fooled by the ruzki tactics, delay and nothing to offer"
"Aljazeera knows the number of Drones sent by Russia, but she doesnt know how many Drones sent by Ukraine. This is why people do not believe a word these media groups"
Ukraine dont want peace talks. They want cease fire to regroup and restock the weapons. Zelensky will loose lots of money (privately) if there are a successful agreement. I hope your channel change your one sided warmongering way. Get real and pray for pease
"Beyond Palestine, AJ is useless."
There is nothing “historic” about tis talk.
World leaders must be the most eager persons to build peace in the world! You all are responsible for humanity in your leadership terms.
"There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”"
There is nothing historic about this meeting.
"waste of time, money and effort"
Why should Russia accept unconditional ceasefire? Why is the west not ready to accept ceasefire with conditions?
"Im looking for job. Accountant, any suitable job. Can u help me anyone"
"Nothing historic about this, where there is no agreement on any issue whatever."
Negotiating while bombs fall ???
Finally turkiye find out dealing peace talking with weapon dealer and weapon consumer....
These talks are a one-way discourse. They do not address Russias demands for a security framework and Russia is under no obligation to give away concessions to a deceitful NATO/EU
A clown he is indeed
"May God give the two the inspiration, the courage, the wisdom and intelligence to see the future in 50 and hundred years from now. Peace is hard to achieve when blood has been flowing but peace must be achieved. Zelenski must stop the cinema. There is no need for him to be present to achieve that peace. Peace talk is usually lead by top diplomats and military leaders. This is not the time for cinema. This is a serious business. Ukraine and Russia will still be bordering each other doesnt matter the the amount of territory Russia take. this is a civil war. The war must stop."
Meanwhile...the genocide in Gaza continues....
Useless Russians. Always running their mouths and trying to be sneaky. Time to grow up Little Putin and Kremlin. Like children.
I am curious. Why are they so desperate now? For 3 years they had meetings without inviting Putin and now they crying that Putin didnt come? Coke snorting white supremacist clowns
Ukraine and its allies pushing for a ceasefire without capitulation
i just listened qatar government just gifted a Boeing plane to trump great strategy
"Russia, chaina, pok, turkey, geopolitics so Captivating."
"Zein, crying like a baby instead of answering the questions."
No deal just waste time..
At some point surely even the old money trustees of Atlanticist imperialism will come to their economic senses and realise that maintaining their wealth through military production and wars is now threatening their very existence especially when considering that so many of their subordinate political class now appear to be permanently stoned.
Peace please.
Putin doesnt want peace.
Do you believe Turkey?
When the world powers have been seeking solutions to the ongoing war in Ukraine there is another massacre going on in Gaza the mother of all atrocity
3rd time in 3years. 3rd time us the charm.
Putin got squared up in his own tricks because he thought Zelensky might sit with those low level squard but nope .He want Putin personally himself in flesh he aint taking no chance but bring out the paranoid butcher like all were in Russian regime always a paranoid state.
The world is looking forward for the best for both and for all. PEACE for better world
Please Boris dont intervene again
This talks has a big potential to fail because Putin in the first place is not interezted. Look who Putin sends they are the low level officials!
"I imagine that after what happened to Denys Kireyev, the Ukrainian delegation will be treading lightly."
A ceasefire before negotiations wont happen unless you capitulate first.
Ukrainian and Russian peace is not well received by the collusion of colonizers.
Qatari suppots terrorist
"so what happened, Putin said he wanted direct talks but is a no show…"
"Talks should be held in Hindustan, why this meeting happening in Turkey. Godi media"
Under Erdogan Direction ....between East Midlle East and West ....Talks Peace in Istambul Crossing wayErever in the world ...Russie and Ukraine .. talks For Peace without Trump
Only 1 Ukrainian in the &quotUkrainian&quot Delegation.
Why does the kiev regime and its handlers want a 30 day ceasefire so bad.
I dont see Russian flag!! or am I missing something
I really don’t understand why the Americans are there. I man they’re to blame for everything
No Russian flag ? What’s wrong with you ? People ??
"This is low intelligence, you spent 350-500 Billon dollars to defeat Russia. That scheme failed, now you are begging for peace"

"Axis of Terrorism - US regime, E3 regimes and TZS regime."
West has no idea about diolomacy and legalities.A lot of ground work between the parties lead to a jointly agreed final draft which the head of the respective states finally sign to make it an official document.
Good job
I would prefer objective journalists instead of propaganda.
Trump is not travelling to the Tel Awiv Terrorists (TATs) State? Why ??
Beware of Ziobots and ignore them.Zio attention seekers deserve no replies.
There will be no ceasefire for West to send more weapons
Who invited US?
"Can anybody point me here to a Russian flag? If there is no Russian flag, I assume Russians are not at the table. Am I wrong?"
What is the US flag doing there?....
Negotiation or capitulation
P0 tin wants more land. more countries.
Turkey self claim peacemaker dream
P0 tin was too afraid to meet the Zel Historical!
Time pass comedy show sponsered by USA. 30 hours gone still no meeting between Russia and Ukraine
Why is Al Jazeera (aka Muslim Brotherhood or Ikhwanul Muslimeen) so pro-Ukraine and so pro-EU?
"It will benefit Ukraine the most at this point, to achieve Peace directly, it will save Ukraine economic control, if the US ends up calling the shots, Ukraines economic independence will be far."
I dont think its very professional for journalists to be reading from their phones :\
I dont know but i think trump can do a lot towards peace he have the wrong people around
I don’t think Putin will agree but still hoping for peace
"And Zelensky cowardly left the talks. It is clear now, he doesnt want Peace."
Hoping for peace between the two countries
So many &quotcomments&quot from FSB trained and paid trolls
Zelensky didnt say thank you again
Putin ha fatto bene a non andare. Poteva essere un tranello per ucciderlo. Non cè da fidarsi degli occidentali. Anche la Turchia più volte è stata ambigua.
What kind of people are Ukrainians!!
This is crazy pro-NATO talk. A peace agreement was ironed out in Istanbul in 2022 without having Putin or Zelensky there. Then Zelensky sabotaged it. All sides must consider each others security concerns. The US regime change operation is not in anyones interest.
War will never in a comedian style.Comedian must note it clearly.
Comedian Zelensky
Zhelensky said no talk low grade Russian authority ? Also he said they are dummy. Now ready to talk
"Asma bint Yazid narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: quotit is not lawful to lie except in three cases: Something the man tells his wife to please her, to lie during war, and to lie in order to bring peace between the people.&quot &lt&lt Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1939 &gt&gt"
"The Prophet said: “There is no Muslim who sends peace and blessings upon me, but the angels will send peace and blessings upon him as long as he sends peace and blessings upon me.” &lt&lt Sunan Ibn Majah 907 &gt&gt"

"President Putin will never sit with an American Puppet like Zelensky, not in a million light years! Everything will be as Russia demands and the US has no role to play except for a show!The US has been supporting, financing, and training Ukrainian Nazis since after WW2, and especially since 2014!Russia will always defeat Nazis and their supporters!"
Putin too scared to show up?
Zelenski is low level. Is a dictator who sacrificed his country for Macron Starmer Boris and Ursula
When a country is in crisis no one helps weaker side.
Ukraine never should of given up its nuclear weapons
Zelensky the Clown
Stop wars Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Thanks to Trump that NATO and EU understood that Turkei is NATO and always strong and valuable..
After first meeting and greetings someone gota say &quotnow go home and get your fkn shine box&quot
Watch out for Boris J
Zilinski is a Jw. What a coincidence ...
At least for a few moments clwonsky was thinking in his head that he is smart then he woke up.
Trump just talk too much
You guys are attacking Russians and Ukrainians not Putin and zelensky
"Ukraine and Russia resume Peace talks??? No one from Russia is there, that can make any decisions, nor, were they ever showing up...yet another Zelensky parade for the cameras....much like your psy-ops....anyone want to join Mikey the alcoholic from Mn go for a drive in a u-haul, with China...say, how did that psy-ops work on four Guardians....it didnt!! and, yes indeed, Im NY Toms very British/Brazilian future wife MD"
What an embarrassment to the comedian
"The talks in Istanbul are unlikely to yield immediate results. Russia views them as an initial exchange rather than a decisive summit, with further meetings already expected on May 16.The core obstacle remains security guarantees. Russia insists on neutral peacekeeping forces, rejecting any NATO or U.S. presence, while Ukraine’s backers oppose troops from Russian-aligned blocs like the CSTO.Even as diplomats convened, the military operations continued. At night, Russian forces launched a wave of strikes across Ukraine, targeting military infrastructure from Sumy to Ivano-Frankivsk. The attacks, involving drones and missiles, highlight Russia’s ability to escalate at will, reinforcing its leverage at the negotiating table.Today’s negotiations are less about compromise than about positioning. Russia holds the initiative, both militarily and diplomatically, while Ukraine scrambles to reconcile Western demands with its weakening battlefield stance. Whether these talks lead to a pause in fighting or merely set the stage for further escalation will depend on whether Kyiv’s allies are willing to concede—or if Russia decides it can achieve more through force."
"What a waste of time! Zelensky pulled out of the talks in 2022 and vowed to defeat Russia on the battlefield. After 3 years of delusion, and losing 500,000 men, 20% of territory and destroying entirely his economy, now hes forced back to the negotiating table by the reality in the field and begging for ceasefire. What a clown!"
Should we follow up this one or the Arabic One ?
Is AJ English originallly Qatarian or sold to England ?
"Trump is assuming too much of himself.Whatever Kellog is whispering in his ears will not do him any good. The Russians have sent a very capable team tasked with discussing the root causes of this war. If Ukraine and its sponsors refuse to acknowledge and discuss these root causes, then, the SMO will continue.If this war continues, Ukraines surrender terms will be very hard."
Now Im convinced that Trump loves Putin
Zelensky just rolls up to Turkey and then doesnt know why hes there. What a tool.
"What shocks me , Ukrainian delegation DOESNT need translators WHILE talking to RUSSIAN Delegation Ukraine accept reality, Russia is your brother"
Im curious if Zelensky now regrets listening to Boris Johnson back in 2022? What a mess they created.
Marco Rubio big ears. Useless!
Why NATO thete? Just to FCK up
Lil´Put is a coward ... everyone knows that...
Every single person that took that picture standing is a puppet. Russia is alone and still winning LOL
Putin called out for Ukraine theyve a direct one on one talks and now we have everything in Istanbul pulling the strings. Why cant they sit aside and let them iron out their issues . Theyre loud as if theyre the disputants.
"Only Russia, Ukraine and USA should be on the table"
a lot of comedians try to Ruin the planet earth
Russia dont have time for all of this sheet
Fools! Putin said he’s restarting talks that was stopped so it’s a continuation
Nato is a terrorist organization and have no right to tell Russia what to do
"Stop talking useless leaders be tough on putin,putin just understand force"
"In a fight, you only lose, not gain."
You started the war w
"Look at human history and you will find out that Allah tests people. The blessings and mercy of Allah always remain on the person who has human compassion and a person is never disappointed. May Allah have mercy on the entire human being, Amen."
"There is an international arrest warrant for Putin. Türkiye, as a member of the ICJ, would have to comply with this order. Putin will not play along with the Wests dirty game."
"So the three joker that went to Kyiv and make rules that Putin must come to table failed. Britain, France and Germany"
Negotiations are taking place but Z world is already making comedy - episode 128
Whats this got to do with nato? Why are they busy?
wtf should putin or zelenski participate in this talks? to make a stupid show out of it? its not the task of a president! there are specialists for that.
Its childs play to arrange for a presidential visit to a foriegn country that to within a day. Leaders like TRUMP and PUTIN. Zelensky comes and goes without any protocol. All NATO and EU nations are easy access for Zelensky
"There will be peace in Ukraine soon, but not today (51525). I have seen the sign, so do not lose hope and stay resolute. Peace is coming. I think maybe 52525, but I am just taking a wild a** guess (WAG), which is pretty much what i have been doing all along. 30 minutes later ... Got it! It is a pseudonym. A magnified image upon itself, by what power I do not know, but the bible says 10 fold. Its a warning! &quotDo onto others as you would have done onto you&quot"
"Nato is there for what? The causer of war there for peace deal???? All its fake, if Putin said he needs to negotiate with Ukraine directly it doesnt mean him himself, the delegates are him"
"NATO should not be in the country, they are just trying to overpower the Russia Ukraine meetings. NATO does not want peace, they just want Russia to surrender. They don’t want Zelensky talking to Putin on his own, they want to be part of it. Ukraine is not a NATO country so NATO should just stay on their own side of the fence."
Putin Putin Putin. Cmon NATO got no better ideas?.
Russia sent necessary delegates for real negotiations why they need Putin to be there? Let the delegates discusse then the President can say what the outcomes! Mr.Vladimir Zelensky looks focused only to meet the Russian President not to the negotiations for peace? Why? The main goal is the peace processe let the delegates talk and come to a conclusions. Please please the whole world want the peace.
"The glory days of Europe are long gone. Putin wont take them seriously, for the mere fact that Europe cant articulate properly Europes strategic interest."
"Russia doesn't need peace for 30 days we need peace for the long term, and only on our terms! And who the hell is in the best position right now? Why the hell should Russia concede anything to this drug addict and these Ukronazis?"
"Rubio is so smart, I love him."
putin is not present because he is fear and guilty like Caino--
30 days of ceasefire to re arm what a joke
Putin has the cards. NATO bla bla bla....
Only dreamers could expect Mr. Putin in Istanbul Ordering The president of Russia in a very Impolite way will never function
Russian conditions will end the war. This metting it’s a waste of time
If you believe Putin will show up !?? You’re crazy.
Why would Putt*n travel there personally to meet a joker
"Putin feels like a small brain next to Zelensky, he doesnt want to be humiliated! He prefers to stay deep in his underground bunker"
"Nobody talks peace with that fruity puppet, Mark Rutte present. NATOs only interest is war and the profits of war."
What a bunch of foolish idiotz
"The media is so focus on Putins person to meet up, he have people to handle things so he can just sign the peacethreaty when it is ready to be signed, that is what a true leader does, not like these other european political clowns travel arround hold meetings and make a lot of statements about stupid things that make no sence and eat and drink alkohol on taxpayers expence....."
"These things are out of the control of any politician or president, as they were long ago decided by Heaven. What we will see is the return of the king of the north - Russia, announced in Daniel 11:29a. Jesus also referred to this event:Matthew 24:6 reads: &quotThen you will certainly hear of battles and next the sounds of battles being fought (this indicates that the current war in Ukraine will escalate). Be careful not to be afraid (this in turn indicates that this war will spread to other countries, escalating to a very dangerous form (with the use of tactical nuclear weapons cf. Am 5:8,9) for everything must come to pass (meaning: to be fulfilled - Jesus here refers to Da <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEaEJe6HB6g&ampt=689"">11:29</a>a) but the fulfillment (implicitly: of the sign) is not yet there–this means that the U.S will not get directly involved in this war, and the strategic nuclear weapon will not be used yet.)&quotAccording to Daniel 11:29a we will see Russia (depicted as the king of the north) RETURN. This means that Russia will again have military bases where it had in the previous century."
These clowns don’t even know protocols
PRIME MINISTER! NOT PUTIN BUT PRIME MINISTER PUTIN
"If they think Putin and Zelensky are the same level then they are all bad jokes made by Zelensky... He can send delegations who Zelensky can talk to.... Putin talks to Zelenskys master, the US president"
2022 Ukraine refused
Who is NATO ? NATO need to answer the war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"Putin hired most of his cabinet, experts and advisors to represent him. That is what is called &quotdelegation&quot, if they can transact business as advised or instructed, or within their powers, so be it. It should be considered a binding agreement. Why do you need Putin in person? If Zelensky was free to attend in person, does it mandate Russia to send its President too?"
This comment section is very obviously filled with orcs. Lot of backward misguided comments.
Zelinsky shouldnt be apart of the negotiations he started hurting the dunbas people denying them right to control their own destiny
"If is to UK and EU this war would continue to last Ukrainian or there is no more Ukraine left,there was no even word peace talk till Trump came on power..."
This useless old girl keep saying nonsense about Russia every given time
"Children get siblings, you idiots"
That's good I'll tell you who I missed
"Women want children from Menna, and these children have siblings"
When I talk to Violet Menna I like it that's good for her.
"Relationships, that's my private life, I don't have to tell anyone who comes into my bed"
Nowhere do I have to talk about my private life.
"have the right to protect myself as a Serb, and my private life I don't have to tell anyone"
"I am a proud Patriota, I do not run away from duties"
"Stop envying me. I protect with my title only Serb Kosovo Metohija and Krajina. Stop envying me, for biological clock my gipt can come conciliation"
Wise move. Erdogan is a shifty b*. Cant be trusted.
So now the delegation members are not of the likes of the West? Russia could send a Cremlin janitor if they want. The people that are sent there represent the country and their policies so who is Zelensky or Nato to judge if they are suitable? What of bunch of clowns... They just want to keep this war going so they can fill their pockets deep enough
Putin never disappoints us hahahaha
"Putin-the butcher is cunning gangster, coward liar, lifeless zombie lacking power to meet with dignified world leaders for peace talk."
Victory for Russia🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 from nigeria 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬.. Same venue same conditions we once talk about 2022... Shame on Johnson and Joe Biden long live russia
"putin is not interested in, has never been. Way past time for trump and rubio to wake up to this fact and act accordingly. In other words sanction the heck out of russia and arm Ukraine to the teeth. The more military pressure against russia the better the chance of ending the war. Rubio is incorrect that diplomacy and not military actions will end it."
Putin send his delegation remember putin cant talk to zelensky because of Ukraine law zelensky sign
"Zelensky can only see Putin when he is about to sign unconditional surrender of Ukraine, on all Russian termsUSA is not some &quotmediator&quot . US is part of the losing side of the conflict, therefore US is not in position to make any demands or &quotconcessions&quot from Russia ( way less UK/EU : )and also - any sanctions on any country without UN Security Council approval are ILLEGITIMATE by International Law - period - and Ms Lindsey Graham is not the goddess, as she might think of herself"
"So they need the Russians too, so they haven't needed Mark so far, what happened?"
"Why not come to us in India for negotiations? We, India, are a world superpower. We have a lot of cow dung and we dont defecate on the road"
Russians are conquering land every day and you expect them to negotiate ceasefire now. Clowns
Putler is a coward and a war criminal
More propaganda doesnt help.
Mr Z has gotten that Putin is wanted by the ICC so he can not attend so the ball is in the hands of ICC to drop the charges.
"Speak to vladmia putin through conference TV .its putin who is not there,but representatives are there.. stop hiding in behind putin."
Putin must be dragged to the negotiation table
"ENOUGH OF THE E.U.s &quotCOALITION OF THE WEAKLINGS!&quot..INSANITY! REALITY CHECK STARMER, MACRON, RUTTE &amp THE REST OF THE LOT, ALONG WITH THE WHOLE COLLECTIVE WEST, have No more sticks to offer Russia- only carrots.. NO MORE ultimatums or coercive threats ..only promises of Goodwill! THE U.S. &amp EUROPE HAVE NO LEVERAGE IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS- SO RUTTE, STOP PUSHING ABSURD NARRATIVES TO A GULLIBLE PUBLICI! This conflict- is a War of attrition..&amp Russia is literally, bleeding-out Ukraine- Militarily &amp The IN-DEBT U.S./EUROPE FINANCIALLY! THIS WAR WILL CONTINUE &amp RUSSIA WILL PUSH EASTWARD TO THE DNIEPER RIVER &amp ODESSA.. NATO/EUROPE- ARE POWERLESS! THIS PROXY-WAR.. IS..THE WORST U.S. FOREIGN POLICY DISASTER- FAR BEYOND: VIETNAM, KOREA, IRAQ, SYRIA LIBYA SOMALIA &amp THE MOST RECENT AFGHANISTAN DEBACLE!"
You cant trust western EU globalists and feminists. They are liers and double talking murderers of minorities
EU doesnt want peace. They want perpetual war against Russia for Ukrainian expanse.
Europe must apply sanctions now and stop following Putins games... Hes delaying and pretending he wants peace.
Putin has arrest out he’s never going to leave his country to a place e feels he can be arrested
Ceasefire . Are you deaf?
JOKERS!!
They are only interested having Putin there so they can criticize him and unload their vitriol on him in public for optics to sway public opinion against him and turn the meeting into a kangaroo court...Putin knows what theyre up to stupid morons.
Russia and Nato not Russia and Ukraine
Zelensky is not considered an legitimate leader by Putin ... no elections...so Putin will not attend.
Stop being Hippocratic Neto should go back to 1991 border
"Putin must be watching out for the EU, and Ukraine has plans for something different from this. Its highly unlikely theyll be assassinated by using polonium. I saw this desperation, Putins seat is empty, so what!"
Putin himself initialted this meeting.. Everyone always knew that Putin wont want end of war.. Putin doesnt wants peace
Clown Zelenskyy followed its Master Boris Johnson command and didn’t broker peace back in 2023
The time of game changers ended now theyre yarning for peace talks. So funny
"NATO getting involved in peace talks , “If Russia willing to play ball” US shouldn’t allow nato to be there, NATO ruins everything!"
You are just as pathetic as the rest of the mainstream media! At NO stage did Putin say he would attend. You with your stupid narratives should not be allowed to report on anything. 
Is Mr Putin a Russian delegate or the Presidentof the Russian Federation?
The Russians ARE sending a delegation - WTF is wrong with these people.
NATO and EU are working day and nite trying selling hateful agenda against Russia except the US
Its when Putin calls for direct talks with Zelensky that suddenly all the NATO representatives crash the party. Now they blame Putin for possibly not showing up.
Putin needs not waste his precious time to meet Zelensky the comedian/ drug addict/ illegitimate &quotpresident&quot
Zelensky signed a decree in constitution prohibiting himself from talking to Putin
"Even if the possibility of Putins arrest or even an assassination attempt were likely to arise, these are only pretexts. Its 2025... He just has to participate directly via video conference. How long will we tolerate Putin insulting our intelligence?"
Remember will be no crying for peace if Ukraine were the winning side
"If Putin goes to Turkey, arrest him."
"Presidents are there to sign deals, not run them governments have a whole army of bureaucrats who are supposed to do that!"
"This Mark Rut guy is not part of the peace talks its between the delegations of Ukraine and Russia, these jokers are the instigators of the problem."
"Putin is a Boss,you dont tell him what to do"
"Putin will only arrive as there are signs of good progress, Lavrov and his staff is a heavy weight enough"
"Zelinski was only carrying out his duties according to instructions from the Jewish Zionists, nothing more. Are the Ukrainian people that weak to accept him and not expel him from their country?"
The problem with the NATO chief is that his view is one-sided. The Trump team is trying to open his eyes and explain to the dude that one-sided views do not help with a two-sided solution. This is pretty obvious for most people.
Russia has cards!
The Finns are looking for trouble.
"I find it abusive and insulting what these so called EU leaders are implying to. It’s not for Zelenskyy and NATO have lost this war. It is not for them and Zelenskyy to dictate. Sleeping with this little egotistical dictator Zelenskyy is like sleeping with the enemy . Exactly at this stage in negotiations it’s a continuation. I cannot believe how super stupid these so called politicians are ? Maybe some of them do not know the full facts ? Germany are going back to their old ways just like Hitler they now think the most important thing is to built an army bigger and better. They have totally miscalculated the youth of today they do not care about fighting for having dominance , they simple do not care two shits they just want peace , trade and education for free and excellent infrastructure. We are on this planet for 75 years , if longer it’s just luck. This is very short time , most trees gets older than that. Even a cup made in China outrun that lifespan. So why do we allow Zionists and Azov and Nazis to make so much death and destruction. They have nothing to bring to the table. Absolutely nothing !"
These so called European leaders dont make sense. Zelensky must get a better advisor.
"It would be desirable if something positive came out of this, but doubtful! The French have sent their Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot to Turkey, which means that Europe intends to give instructions to the Ukrainian delegation! 2022 will be a repeat! The West will continue its war against Russia at the expense of the Ukrainians. The Estonians (Estonian patrol boat Raiu), the Poles (MiG-29 fighter jet), and NATO (helicopters) also attempted to hijack a Russian civilian ship in neutral waters in the Baltic Sea!"
ahhhh...the Germo-trash really got a lot to say
Idiotic idiotic and time wasting for Putin to attend Istanbul talks....
"Clown , rotten politician … he licked arses to get his position.. from ridding bicycle to kill peoples … green killer"
"I guess we’re seeing the power of Zelenskyy’s demands in real time. Him demanding Vladimir Putin’s presence in negotiations while losing to Russia on the battlefield,won’t even get Lavrov"
Their are blaming someone else for the mess they created you want to defeat Russian to send china message
Why is Nato there?
The war is a Ball. NATO is an empty Ball.
putin still hiding in his gold plated bunker?
PUTIN THE COWARD!!
"Leaders never meet to initial meetings. Putins never say he will come, and Zelensky is not a legitime leader, he can not decide and sugn anything. And NATO have lost there proxy war."
"EU and NATO are stupid, get out, go to hell"
"I wonder who these European propaganda so-called leaders are trying to fool! A negotiation team never include presidents, only their delegates. Somebody tell them that neither Xi nor Trump went to Switzerland."
without any ground work and negotiations in lower level. How do head of state ever meets. Europe just want to set a negative perceptions. Its just all a lie and gimmick.
Putin didnt meet terrorist like American and Trump
"The second lady speaking about chairs is soooo stupid, man shes dumb"
Russians are always to blame for everything. Ukraine does nothing wrong. These EU leaders must think were all fools.
stupid people talking about stupidity. Do you truly think that President Putin is your little toy. You all lot have played him before remember. Stop the projection and narrative. Delusional
Is Boris Johnson attending
You guys are attacking Russians not Putin
NATO cant tell Russian what to do
Aljazeera is an Arabic channel pretending to be a Western channel. Leaders dont meet until all the necessary issues have been ironed out by their respective envoy.
Can we stop pretending Russia worth trusting in anything? Putin is nothing but a vicious killer.
"You guys wanted only the defeat of Russia, you never spoke to Russia for some years, its Ludacris to start calling for a negotiation you never wanted."
Rutte! The biggest warmonger! You are the most corruption politician in dutch history!
Inviting Russia to the Nato meeting?
Where is Poupou ???
Peace at last
Comedian as president
The lies are amazing. Putin doesnt need to turn up. Remember peace summit without Russia in Switzerland and ban on negotiations signed into law by Ukraine
Putin is very clever
Finnish foreigner minister woow ... she is good looking
What About gaza Palestinians
Only Ukraine and Russia with the help of Turkey should negotiate not these useless European leaders all are stupid
"zelensky is an idiot, Putin have said what he wants to end the war finished."
"It was narrated that Umar said:
 &quotThe Messenger of Allah saw me urinating while standing, and he said: O Umar, do not urinate standing up. So I never urinated whilst standing after that.&quot &lt&lt Sunan Ibn Majah 308 &gt&gt"
quotThe Messenger of Allah said: Most of the torment of the grave is because of urine .&quot &lt&lt Sunan Ibn Majah 348 &gt&gt

Dimitri from Istanbul Ok
"NATO sponsored Disinformation and propaganda is literally flying over here , no difference between BBC and Al Jazeera"
I’m doing one better. I’ll be hosting Russia Ukraine peace talks at my house and I won’t be inviting either of the concerned parties.
"Can’t you people negotiate without Putin?? He has sent his delegation so what’s your problem now. Zelenskyy isn’t ready for peace cos he could hv make peace with Russians before this goes far, he told the world that he’s not ready to have talks with the Russians directly last year. So why will he expect Great Leader like Putin to be there?? That kid isn’t ready to learn. He’s following these western peoplethe war is in your country not on these western countries, so if he will be there playing games then it is his own."
Erdogan is a coward dont trust on him coward
So sad the Russians are scared.
"Palestine, Indian Occupied Kashmir and Ukraine Deserve Peace in there Respected Countries"
Sending delegations are just as binding as going in person. Ukraine has no need to sword rattle during an actual invasion. Hopefully a just peace returns to the area.
Gaza is completely destroyed and level down but world is silenced!! What a double standards era we’re living in?!!!
"We Want peace in Ukraine, Palestine and Indian Occupied Kashmir"
NATO is a bunch of unruly mobs bent on disorganizing the evolving multipolar world order
Putin is good
There are no cesfire
Why is this about the world realising its about the active parties to come and discuss a way forward
Pres Putin is 2busy to be present to play any more of their wicked games by warmongers who refuse to admit €pic-FaiI-Defeat of all time and Space
Meanwhile Donbass front is crumbling. The spring foliage gave an opportunity to desert relatively safely for hapless cannon fodder kidnapped off the streets (Ukrainian drone attacks on fleeing deserters are much more problematic when they can find some cover). Ukrainian trenches are emptying at warp speed.
No Russia rightly does not need to talk with unqualified Zelensky... he has been told what to do for war end already ..no more games
Putin is always a step ahead of you
What a surprise PUTIN is a coward
"Well leave them alone , no need to interfere"
Putin great leader
"Im not even understanding what a ceasefire will even achieve to be honest, too much has happened"
"O parlamento europeu, biden antes e trump agora, onu, tribunais penais internacionais, otan, legionários cristãos franceses e ingleses, vaticano, ocidente cristão e todas suas forças nazistas genocidas maléficas não derrotarão a Rússia agora qual não derrotaram a Rússia durante WW2. Podem até tentar mas, NÃO a derrotarão. E agora Rússia tem companhia da China, Coréia do norte e a minha, claro! 😊"
To the war criminal Trump Russia war is stupid but israel war is not. dont forget to hold trump responsible for war crime too
sanction aint working
free Palestine
They have been telling Russia this since the war started
&quotEuropean leaders&quot?? The 5 clown &quotsummit&quot have approval ratings of 88 - collectively.Let that sink in.
Did 🇪🇺 bring thier wallet?
"NATO has lost and is embarrassed. They bought an army and lost. Thats the truth. Tell them to send troops. The United States wont join them, so they are weak and scared."
Ukraine is defacto the bulwark against Russian aggression.
The bravery express?
But Donald Trump was supposed to end this on DAY ONE !!! guess he was lying all along
NATO war
We want peace
EU
"By the time the SMO ends, ethnic Russians and their lands will not be left in whatever remains of Ukraine. Ukraines surrender terms will be very hard"
Trump joker of the century India Pakistan ceasefire is collapse now
how are these Leaders? Peace by Monday or we will continue supporting the war ?
"If I was Putin I would be skeptical. Is the ceasefire truly geared towards peace or to give Ukraine time to reorganize? Russia offered a good deal to end the war 2 years ago but they refused. Now that things are bad for them, they want one?? really??!!"
This is a group of warmongers! Have no regard for human life! Only greed for business for their cronies!
These leaders suit in boot never talking about peace no one care for loss of livesPeace peace peace please
Didnt Trump say he would end it in 24 hours? What a clown
"If Putin plans to continue toward his stated goals, Ukraine being a &quotcornerstone of European security&quot means the war cannot be stopped."
And if Putin says no then they will urge once more. And again once more....
Ukraine EUcountries dont stop fighting.Couse Putin second wave of retaliation is more worse against European countries.
Such bunch of incompetent political leaders in Europe. Firstly they still do not understand who already won the proxy war. May be going to Kiev is just for R &amp R hosted by clown Z. Whole world knows Ukraine Govt is among top 3 corrupted countries. Fact is Europe is irrelevant and no longer a priority of USA or any other country.
Comedians-EU- who are they to demand anything from Russia?
Why Zelenskyy and the EU gone mad for ceasefire after ukraine losing almost everything?In the past Russia almost beg for that but the clown introduced law for no negotiation?
Rubish
"Where is the coalition of the sausages for Gaza, HYPOCRITES!"
ukraine
Ukraine 🇺🇦
Ukraine 🇺🇦
Why do they keep saying EU leaders when theres only a few of them there? Where were the rest? Some were in Moscow for victory day events.
Why is starmer there?UK isnt a member of the EU
Seems like they feel Ukraine is going to crumble in this summer. Too desperate otherwise before Ukraine want ceasefire on its terms now at all cost
Pinocchio and 3 clowns
"Some of EU leaders like Macron, Merz and UK prime minister just a joke no one in world will get their words serious."
Ceasefire ? .... Now at the end they are requesting for ceasefire.
"EU leaders and the Kiev regime are so out of touch with reality, that anyone watching cant take them seriously."
Proposing a ceasefire from Ukraine and 32 NATO + EU countries sounds like a unconditional surrender to me
The joker strikes again. EU politicians fooled and let down its people again.
Why you are ignorant NATO has sacrificed Afghanistan people to terrorists fascist Taliban
Leaders enjoying Russia cease fire While funding war for profit
Russia is winning this War they dont need to negotiate to anyone
And then what will happen after 30 days?
Russia doesnt care... EU/NATO playing clown show.
Where was this*ceasfire* in 2022?
I remember the Ukrainian president not agreeing to the Russian proposed 3 days ceasefire and yet they want Russia to accept a 30-day ceasefire they are definitely planning something for a 30 day ceasefire
EU leaders are losers. Russia doesnt care.
Russia is not a wealthy country. Stay the course and the US and Europe can so easily bring Russia to its knees. Stop being such a coward Donald Trump! For once in your life do something noble!
Putin is evil but he’s not stupid. He won’t back down.
More like World Cheer Leaders!
sanctions you say huh? why didnt anyone think of this before!?! lol
Russia never asked for a ceasefire just like Russia never asked for the west to recognize the new Russian territory the EU are irrelevant.
"The ultimate battle of the losers , lmao"
Let’s get Russia and Ukraine to the table. Let’s broker a ceasefire!
Deeply unpopular WEF warmongers.
"Have you asked yourselves why these leaders suddenly want a ceasefire? Why they are no longer interested in the &quotdefeat&quot of Russia? Ill tell you, these clowns wanna achieve what they couldnt achieve on the war frontlines diplomatically, they are so eager to send their so-called &quotpeacekeeping &quot force which will be used to force the whole of Europe into a wider war. These leaders think others are fools, Ukraine can negotiate while at war if all sides are being honest. Its a shame you guys arent pointing out this obvious fact."
Ukraine should understand the position Gaza is in. Ukraine knows what’s its like to have ceasefires only broken again and again by Russia. This is literally what’s happening in Gaza with the ceasefire deals. The ceasefire back in January was broken the minute Netanyahu decided to bomb Gaza again despite Hamas following the deal. Yet Ukraine chooses to support Israel. And the west blindly follows this stance
"These group supported the Maidan coup in Kiev a decade ago. They thought theyd succeed where Napoleon &amp Hitler failed. 10 years to prepare on the biggest armies in Europe, in a country fortified by the Soviets during the Cold War. Now they are on the backfoot they think they can call the shots??? Minsk 2 was very fair. Thats no longer the case now. Unconditional surrender should be the way!!!"
Uk is not in the EU and England voted for Brexit dragging Scotland out along with them...
Uh!?
Coalition of the timid
Ukraine will use the ceasefire to regroup and rearm
Ukraine has no cards
Once again the old boring eu
Why for 30 days requesting to end the war or do you want time to buy to reorganize the troops .
European sanctions are like to Russia
"Those who died for liberation of Europe in WW2 would turn in their graves, while seeing our clowns, and what Europe has become."
"Since the &quotWest&quot and Ukraine has proven to be untrustworthy with deals they signed, Russia would be foolish to agree to any cease-fire now. Putin has to reduce Ukraines territory until it cant be a threat or a possible attraction for NATO."
How can they pressure a country that doesn’t need them its just stupid
allcorrupt..zelensky is bad news
What will they do if Putin refused to their ceasefire? Russia will never allowed you to rebuild your military capabilities and attack them. No ceasefire will happen until you address the root causes of the conflict.
Europe you are waking up but its late
the west become funny
"Yes, it means the coalition is surrender for Russia. Whats shameful, this signal to Russia, if they want to invade any smaller country they can do so."
I think that Donald Trump will demand that Russia immediately withdraws from Kherson and Zaporizhia Oblasts as they have no legal or moral right to be there as a precondition to a ceasefire otherwise the war will intensify to a new level.
Negotiate a realistic final deal.
"Why push for ceasefire, when what’s key is push for negotiations, out of which ceasefire will result."
Sanctions is nonsense
What pathetic hypocrisy!! Wasnt it the who passed the decree back in late 2022 to banned all negotiation with Russia?? And now that things arent going in his favor he wants to cry to the E.U saying &quotPlease force Russia to negotiate a 30-day unconditional ceasefire with us NOW&quot waaaaaaaa . Only when this clown is outright remove from power or deleted can there be any possibility of Russia accepting any sort of long term ceasefire.
Lol. 30 days ceasefire. I gues winning side will not agree. I dont know how more sanctions will work. Since they already applied all stick and carrots. So they ate out of all types of options.
"Peace is good. NATO, stop creating, supporting and starting Wars."
Western desperation
Russia 🇷🇺 Russia 🇷🇺 Russia 🇷🇺
Pressure???
More crying
NATO defeated
"Stop the killing, where?"
Zelensky is a comedian
"When youre losing a conflict, a ceasefire gives UKRAINE time to reposition their troops, halt Russia continued gain of Ukrainian territory, rearm, and train more Ukrainian troops. E.U. and U.K. never want to address the root causes of conflict, and theyb continue to say Ukraine will be a part of NATO. Russia will not agree to Ukraine being in NATO. So, ceasefire is like the Minsk agreement. German Chancellor Merkel admitted the Minsk agreement was to give time to arm and build up the Ukrainian army. NATO wasnt seeking lasting peace."
Compare this with the celebration in Moscow.
"Only days ago the EU leaders were threatening with sanctions and excusioun the Slovenian and the Serbian and all other presidents not to attend the celebrations for 80-years since Victory day in Moscow, disrespecting the great sacrifice of the Russian people in 1945. Now they want to speak? On 9 May there was a very informative spreach in the UN by the Russian diplomat, where he explains that nazzism started as an European issue and still fascism arises often as European, imperialist issue with hatred to minorities, Jews and Slaves, where the Belarus and Russia were in their plan to be exterminated. VERY INTERESTING Belarus lost every third person in the 2Nd WW, Russia lost every 5th China suffered next. Countries who have suffered the most and fought for their independence, they value their freedom and would not want to knee to imperialists ideas."
"They want a cease fire to rearm and reorganize to fight back Russia , but they dont want to end the war"
"This world is in the deplorable state it is today because some countries have the right to impose sanctions on others based on their own economic interests and not really to protect citizens, and this is nonsense that puts small countries at a disadvantage. And I wonder how Russia, which is a major world power, can be sanctioned by Europeans who do not have its military capacity and who will take advantage of this to destabilize it militarily, when it was Ukraine that provoked Putin by refusing to remain quietly and live as good neighbors. Because it is all this so-called regulatory nonsense that allows certain countries and leaders to do what they want with total impunity, which is the case for Netanyahu, while on the other hand, we want to prevent Russia from protecting its borders in order to allow Zelensky to introduce their spies into Russian territories to be able to sow chaos and disorder."
Poor west begging for a ceasefire now huh ? what happened to the empire ?
"Stop the killings say USA why dont say that to Israel and sanction that country ? - Trump is an idiot knows nothing about countries history, culture traditions"
"What’s happened to the coalition of the willing?Pressure point is happening now ,what have they been doing for the last 3 years?"
To simply Rearm!
"Russia needs peace and securities that NATO and western warmongers will stop further attempts of militarising Ukraine for future aggression from the west using Ukraine and from Ukraine, they have had many previous peace treaties before, which Ukraine, UK, US-NATO &amp allies broke every time and kept militarising the Ukraine armies despite these peace agreements, since the US coup of the democratically elected government in Ukraine in 2014."
So Zelensky seeing he cant win and wont get lost lands talk of peace - - should have thought about it 3 years ago
Bunch of Joker
Putin would be an idiot if he allowed european politicians to delude him ones more.
Wonder when they will include the russians in their peace talks… this is so stupid.
They are losing more land thats why they want peace now
"They look pathetic. Hastily organized summit very likely in response to the grand affair in Mowscow on the 9th, looks like a sad party many people refused the invite."
"Ceasefire will come on Russian terms! NATO is in panic mode and it needs this 30-days to rearm and rearrange itself! Russia is not Libya, Afghanistan and Yugoslavia where NATO forces dictated terms!"
"G7, NATO, COW, Fantastic Four. New name, same outcome."
"This people are comics, what more are they going to sanction that they havent already? If there was anything that they could do they will just do it not threaten it. I really feel sad for European citizens that are suffering for lack of leadership."
The Coalition of the Brave
Its all nonsense and worthless and effect less and theres nothing that western more specially Europe can do all they know is how to milk their taxpayers
"So why are you pushing for a ceasefire that will benefit Putin, why dont you just get on with it and settle it on the battlefield as you previously claim you wanted?????"
These guys are pathetic. They just turn my stomach.
"Ukraine has been winning the war for the last 3 years, why the call for a ceasefire?"
Theyre like that dude whos into bondage but forgot the safe word smack in the thick of it!
These leaders threatening Russia…..they need to go to diplomacy school.
"they will not accept Putine ceasefire, but they want Putine to agree to their ceasefire??? these guys are not serious"
What no Donald Trump
Thousand of sanctioned from cowards European and Russia continue to stand
Russia would be crazy to do so.
Russia doesn’t respond to bullying
So many bots in here...
Whos France to issue threat of Sanctions against Russia. None of your sanctions ever worked as planned.
Who are they to demand...to regroup.....like the cheating of the Minsk agreement....
No pressure on Russia. They want to show EU is stronger....They dont have any card to play...
I feel ashamed for the leaders who repeatedly make fools of themselves. They dont even see they looks like clowns.
Starmer could have asked Macron for 30 days of no rubber boats at sametime..? After all hes paying them millions .......??
"Devil incarnate, always planning Evil"
"Fico is a one of the few leaders in Europe with brain. EU, NSATO ans US are the responsible of this mess. Glory to Russia, China and the multipolar world. The collective west has finished to make damage around the world."
They are demanding Russias surrender and that is just not going to happen.
4 clowns in search of visibility
“If you want to stop in your term why he started from the first place?
Who cares what Ukraine wants
Lol so Russia should stop producing weapons too in order for the West to stop arming Ukraine during the ceasefire?
Theres a sinister plan behind this temporary 30 days ceasefire plan. I hope Russia will not fall for this
I wonder what’s left to sanction that Biden didn’t sanction. The Big man in Moscow has the entire west on its knees where they belong
Putin should agree for ceasefire and have pitty on hummanity
"The power house is pushing for cease fire . During the early stages of the war Putin always said hes open for dialogue, Boris and his friends said continue fighting we will arm you now they are losing badly they talking of cease fire Putin is not in a rush. His economy is not doing great but its far from collapsing but western companies which relied on Russian gas have already collapsed"
Russia will agree to a ceasefire after Ukraine surrenders haha.
Peace on soon
Why not an unconditional ceasefire in Gaxa
The quickest way to end this war is for Ukraine to accept Russias conditions for peace.
Europeans can not make ceasefire demands just because they want to stop a Russian summer offensive. Threatening Russia with sanctions is now just a joke. Ukraine can not lose the conflict and expects not to suffer its consequences. The problem here is that just peace for Europe simply means the defeat of Russia. Pretending that Russia would invade NATO territories is hot air since none of them have moved their economies to war footing in preparation of this great war to come.
"These people are completely hilarious ,do they really think Russia will accept a ceasefire on their terms"
They want to put pressure on Russia by collectively holding their breath or...?
"Is this ceasefire a window for rearming Ukraine? If so, it is DOA."
Sanctions on Russia worked so well the first time that another round would be even more devastating. Russia must be shivering in their boots
They arent in the position to call for ceasefire. Why they dont call for Peace. They never talked about anything until Trump did call for Diplomacy. Sanctions are on us the EU citizens
It is completely irresponsible for them to interfere when they have no power to do anything but harm.
"What about Gaza ? Double Standards!!! All Human lives matter irrespective of caste , colour , creed , religion and steps should be taken for humanity to prevail .. That’s what is the job of world leaders … But unfortunately it’s a filthy game of power , politics, self interests and extremist ideologies."
"Unconditional ceasefire, but Russia has a condition Europe must stop supplying Ukraine with weapons, but its O.K for China, Iran &amp North Korea to supply Russia with weapons…."
What happened to the Coalition of the Willing??
are they really still threatening Russia with sanctions
Just recognised Russians territorys and no nato to kyiv and European stops military aids to Ukraine
Its a tough suggestion by Europe to deal with complete ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia and warned Russia of more sanctions if Russia fails to respond... European nation must continue support Ukraine militarily to defend itself from massive drones and missiles attack from Russia...
Now the want ceasefire hhhhaaaahhhaaa
Why 30 days ceasefire
why would the ukraine want a ceasefire when theyre winning.......LMAO
Russia is NOT afraid of more sanctions. Russia has the support of its BRICS and Global South allies 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
"What a joke? Why not a permanent ceasefire for good and address the root cause of the problem? Why 30 days ceasefire? Then rearm after 30 days? These guys are big time jokers. If you want to solve a problem, you address the root cause, its simple."
Zelensky doesnt want a ceasefire and his idle threats were a joke. Why didnt get attack moscow? We were waiting on him to go full ball. Or is it he realized russia sent missiles to the border aimed at kyiv. Sanctions wont work. It hasnt worked at all.
"Am surprised that putin wants west to stop giving weapons to Ukraine so that he quickly take over Ukraine in less than one month. But you are getting weapons from North Korea, china, Iran and a host of others unnamed countries."
"How can the west discussed peace without Russia the west have to respect Russia first but in the peace , discussed without Russia Ukraine will never see peace das the fact the west are fighting Russia in the name of Ukraine they no very well without United State the west will never challenge Russia they dont have capacity to fight Russia"
"Ukraine needs to surrender period! Putin ain’t going to ceasefire for 30 days, he’s no idiot like those clowns…"
They push for 30 years ceasefire after talks with only one party who rejected a 3 day ceasefire.
EU is just failed in everything!!!
Western PROPAGANDA! Ceasefire in this context is a euphemism for rearming Ukraine and slipping NATO forces into it. Why is Al Jazeera English Pro-Nazis?
I heared Ukraine was winning. Why beg for ceasefire. I dont see Putin crying over ceasefires
When they lose they call for a ceasefire
They want a timeout in war clown culture
Is Russia even aware there is any talk of cease fire on monday
Just a bunch of hypocrite
Pressure point? Whats that?
"&quotstrong pressure&quot, like a fart in a storm"
"Everybody know Talk is cheap ,right? ."
The side thats losing the war is making demands
Why is stamer there? The UK isnt in the EU
US president Trumps said in his interview European leaders r begging him to call Pitin.Because Kremlin doesnt respond to them. whats a clown show...
NATO is desperate for a ceasefire
I guess they gone for the clowns family photo
"Sanction tariff hampered western countries not Russia, I think."
"Behold: There was a fettered man beside Abu Muisa. Mu`adh asked, &quotWho is this (man)?&quot Abu Muisa said, &quotHe was a Jew and became a Muslim and then reverted back to Judaism.&quot Then Abu Muisa requested Mu`adh to sit down but Mu`adh said, &quotI will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of Allah and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that the man be killed, and he was killed. Abu Musa added, &quotThen we discussed the night prayers and one of us said, I pray and sleep, and I hope that Allah will reward me for my sleep as well as for my prayers.&quot &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 6923"
Keir Starmer is every bit as despised in the UK as Trump himself.
begging for ceasfires the front must be colapsing
Everyone enabling this war is the enemy
The Palestinian children dont have food
When you lose a war you cannot dictate terms to anyone. The West needs to stop living in an alternate reality and accept their defeat.
We stand with Russia 🇷🇺
having a summit every two weeks. Every time and no outcome
Go russia go
Coalition of the willing are no longer willing to fight anymore
They want 30 day ceasefire and not permanent ceasefire. 30 days for Ukraine to rearm and regroup.
Israel is committing Genocide against Palestinians both in Gaza and the occupied territories...it should stop.
What waste of money NATO Clown s stiogey army no matches Mighty Russy hahaha
Russia will never let the western clowns dictate conditions to them.
Putin doesnt need a window
Russia already give their terms for cease-fire. Why are they being ignored? The Wes is not really interested in a cease-fire they just wanna buy tag to be Ukraine.
When will the EU leaders realize their strategy of arrogance is not going to work?
"Rachted up EU sanctions , How many are there now?16000, 18000"
"If Ukrainian was winning, they would not be calling for ceasefire"
Putin is king
Symbolic????
"You should have learned by now : The same GLOBALISTS are pushing for nuclear war in India~Pakistan, are pushing for nuclear war in Europe~Russia, are pushing for nuclear war in Iran~Israel. Its literally the same group of people behind all three wars..."
"What BS ?, Russia needs to shore up its forces, Even more ridicolous fairytale then the one about Russians fighting with spades"
"Why should Putin listen to these set of clowns , they have shown Russia its true colorRussia is winning now they are begging for time to regroup and rearm. Cease fire my as$"
So u begin a proxy war and what to end it when u lose..
Go Russia 🇷🇺 go.
I didnt realise how deluded European leaders are. If Ukraine and Europe doesnt capitulate then Russia will take the whole of Ukraine.
these fools talk among themselves and think it will bring ceasefire
This is a trap
Yes now they want a ceasefire.For what?To re-arm Ukraine now that Biden stockpiles of weapons is running out.Minsk 3 movie wont be for viewing soon
Finally they call for a ceasefire not calling for more weapons
What u doing
"Yes Russia looks very isolated at the moment, May 9th celebrations looked like Russia is very isolated."
cover the latest news of pakistan violated the crossfire
"The coalition of stupid bankrupts. They will have to do what Trump says. Biden provoked this senseless war, and the whole world is hoping President Trump will make a deal with the Russians to end this special Russian operation."
"Dont talk on behalf of US, EU doesnt want peace. It wants victory through back door."
European puppets
They are complete jokers
EU leaders are bunch of clowns…
These same leaders refused to talk to Russia for three years. All of a sudden a ceasefire is urgent.
"Great Russia, great Putin !!!"
We want peace all around the world.Plz stop killing innocent lives.Prayer from Pakistan.
There should absolutely be NO cease fire until Russia takes Kiev and removes Zelensky from Ukraine
"Because Russia 🇷🇺 is Losing! The Moscow elite don’t wana fight it ! He can’t build enough weapons,tanks or vehicles &amp financially cannot pay for it either!"
What is it?
Of course it's cool
"If you look closely at the event, you'll notice that these people are all dictators. It's a shame General Kim wasn't there, which made the event less glorious."
"Lukashenko is the President of Belarus, which is European too. What about Armenia? Azerbaijan?"
Is this comment section controlled by bots ?
"The Holocaust museums in the US dont say a single word about the sacrifice of the Soviet soldiers, who fought to liberate the prisoners of the Holocaust."
Oh btw Israel is invited as well
"Russians are really draconian, it is like Russians still live in the 1930s. How can you praise a murderer like Putin? Do Russians like murderers? This is not real news because the reporting is not all inclusive, it only touches the surface, extremely lightly."
"They conveniently ignore the fact that in 1939 they were allied with Hitlers Nazis, invaded Poland and when the Nazis turned on the Soviet Union, (not Russia) 100s of thousands of Ukrainians died fighting in the Red Army to defeat the fascists, but why let facts get in the way of Putin delusions!"
white people will start WW3 real soon.
"Reuters 15th June 2022 - the EU looks to replace Russian gas by signing a landmark Memorandum of Understanding trilateral trade agreement with Israel and Egypt.• 2024, International Criminal Court issues arrest warrant for Netanyahu• 2025, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi attends the WWII Victory Day, 80th anniversary parade, in Red Square.The EUs energy commissioner Kadri Simson, hailed the agreement with Israel and Egypt as a &quothistoric day&quot for the EUs energy engagement and energy security, calling the two countries &quotreliable and strategic&quot partners.&quotWhat a special moment,&quot the European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said, in a joint news conference alongside the Israeli and Egyptian energy ministers.What a clown show!"
Cool of course

"what is that nonsense of business, China is growing up, great development, meanwhile Russia, EU,USA falling down, that is the news, real news, you like it or not, probably now fans will start to hate me, thats why is better for you to listen fake news, or watching some telenovelas, if you miss the love."
Ww3 has started in india and pakistan and look at these people.
RUSSIA and Putin looking a Strong presentation on the WORLD but why showings Chinese plastic Doll while this video Pakistan buying that plastics toys and now roaring 🇮🇳🇷🇺

Nice!
Balha is going to beg
President Putin is the big boss. Where is wackjob Trump.
Russia and Putin are truly great. Russia and Putin are too strong for any country to destroy.
Where is modi godi
"Chapter: Punishments ,It was narrated from Abu Malik Ash’ari that the Messenger of Allah said:“People among my nation will drink wine, calling it by another name, and musical instruments will be played for them and singing girls (will sing for them). Allah will cause the earth to swallow them up, and will turn them into monkeys and pigs.” &lt&lt Sunan Ibn Majah 4020 &gt&gt"
"Chapter: The sale of slaves, Chapter on the sale of slaves , Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri that while he was sitting with Allahs messenger we said, &quotOh Allahs messenger, we got female captives as our booty, and we are interested in their prices, what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?&quot The prophet said, &quotDo you really do that? It is better for you not to do it. No soul that which Allah has destined to exist, but will surely come into existence.&quot &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 2229 &gt&gt"
Did they mention Russia partnering with nazis in divid7ng Poland and its territory? Or Stalin killing millions of their own? Oh I forgot that serbs and russians have their own history and choose to ignore reality :)
Britain stood alone against Germany in 1940/41 while Russia were the Nazis allies and signing pacts with Hitler to split Poland in half. The paranoid coward Stalin went missing for months when Germany invaded the soviet union!
all should agree that russia and ukrainians were the closest to each other than any allies. Its brothers war.
Lend lease is a business in expence of others
hahahahahah Americans
8 out of 10 casualties were incurred by Nazis in the eastern front (Russian front)!
"Nato is not the world. The Europeans wars( pseudonymed world war 1,2) is a perfect example, that showed the english world and britain monopoly is temporary. Their life was truly devastated by axis powers. Prosperity, economy, wealth all gone."
Axis Power Without Germany Was Not Exist In The Same way Ally power without Russia Do not Exist
Russia Should Increase its Technology
The celebration is inside Russia. Why should foreigners be invited to a celebration inside your own land. Thank you and Namaste.
Lol what a title
.....China was there....
So are you getting your still getting paid from the US State department? I never knew that Arabs were such spineless cowards.
It was weird seeing Ukrainian troops marching in Moscow. To think that many of those Ukrainian troops that were marching in Moscows Red Square in 2010 (when Russia and Ukraine were still allies) may now be fighting the Russians today.
"There were many allies present, just no Western allies. China &amp Mongolia both fought against Japan, and all the former Soviet republic nations who attended (such as Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan) had thousands of soldiers each who fought in the ranks of the Red Army.And lots of people from Vietnam &amp Laos (though they were not independent countries yet) fought for the allied cause too. Meanwhile the USA, despite their great contribution to WW2 back in the day, did not host any parades or celebrations as far as Im aware, and did not attend any other countries celebrations. Not even the parade in London. Disappointing..."
&quotTo stop him now or to stop him later?&quot That is the question!
"TAN, 24"
Absolute shame how quickly the west have forgotten the history..
"Russians occupied Europe from 1945-1989. 45 years occupying land that never belonged to them, terrorizing the survivors of the war. Russians should be ashamed of themselves . Russia as a nation is known for war crimes and oppression. Russia will never be respected by the rest of the world. Russian people should be embarrassed of where they come from"
The RusZian invaders military parade.
The American deep state are at fault for turning Ukraine into a puppet state after the coup 11 years ago.
"South Africa, a WWII ally, was there"
DECIEVING TITLE 00000 al Jazeera is not independent
Now they are the nazis
In Moscow for Celebration Victory Day ....Xi with Putin ....Celebrations80 years Old and Celebrations Friedship Today
Ofc Trump would say they did more hes full of himself they didnt do anything just sit back and watch USSR killed more and sacrificed more
"you people (comments) are all emotional, its all about business,!!! you freaks"
"Except in Palestine issue, al jazeera is always pro western in every other issue"
AI Jazeera English is now standing with English ?!!? I thought this channel is more leaning towards middle east region ... no ? I was wrong ! But you are wrong to say no other WW2 allies ? what about China ? Yup you were right about the US not joining this Victory Day as they were the ally of Russia and China.
How does Germany feel about this whole thing of victory day? Just wondering
The 2 bullies.pouotin and xijingpee.1 in eastern europe who is losing against ukraine and 1 in asia bullying other asian countries and soon will realise what his comrade pooutin felt.the 3days war already 3yrs and asking kimjung burger man to support him with manpower.
Why didn’t Japan come and celebrate
"The title was written by a brainwashed person, Much Love to Russia"
Russia doesnt even need those western hypocrites...
Russia doesnt even need those western hypocrites...
"Great, another Western arrogance and ignorance over China being one of the most important allies in the World War II."
"The so-called “Victory Day” lost its meaning since Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea and their invasion of Ukraine. Fortunately, the three Baltic states decided not to observe it."
"Everyday, Aljazeera drops to a new low"
"The west can’t beat Russia , it’s Russia vs NATO"
Stop watching Indian media and watch independent sources which your country has unfortunately blocked. Indian army is not Bollywood hero which is working on some script 😅😅😅
Halocast never happened
I deadass thought they won the Ukraine war
"Sorry, this is out of topic. i found an account of someone that used Al Jazeeras name but the owner always sending hateful and provocative comments, how to report it to Al Jazeera? Beside that i already reported that person to YouTube. The channel is @AlJazeera_indonesiaThanks."
Closing airspace to prevent other sovereign countries in Europe from attending…that’s petty AF
83% of Nazis died due to to Russian forces &quottools&quot
Parade of Evil
How does Russia take the credit for winning WW2…. Just because they lost more soldiers? How does that make sense?? That only means they sucked and got more of their soldiers killed…. until US came to the rescue! 🫡🇺🇸
It’s the U.S. who backed the Germans to begin with.
The title is incorrect. No other Western allies were present. Countries like China and Mongolia were the Soviet allies during the WW2 and they were present.
Thats all Russia can do is walk up and down the street...
International Pariah
Pretty sure China is a key ally in WW2 and participated in the parade. No one cares if the western countries don’t participate. They didn’t contribute much anyway
Shame on Palestine president who let his ppl die in hungry while he eats and gets fat. Shame on that fat old man
Netanyahu and Putin together on doing sadly bad things to innocent people.
"If the British or Americans defended Stalingrad, I wonder what the outcome would be?"
"The era of Western dominance is ending. Russia and China have risen to reshape the global balance. With Russia’s May 8 military pride, the East is showing its strength. Multipolarism is no longer a distant concept—it is the reality we live in. The East has already won."
Russia sacrificed the most to defeat NAZIs... Who are now being supported by NATO
ALL- LIES are in NATO
They lost more than 27 million people to fight the Nazis
Russia started WWII by invading Poland as part of the plan to split it with Germany.
Russians are the WINNERS AND HEROES of WW2. The west is living in the past with the feeling of nazism and russophobia. With the victory of Trump the west will be isolated and challenged by the US.
Aljazeera will never mention the africa leaders. Aljazeera is a racist channel always negative about africa.
Anti NATO
Now IS the NEW WORLD ORDER Taking SHAPE Led By GREAT CHINA and MOTHER RUSSIA !!! SAID in the REST of the World ....... PERIOD .
Al jazeera publishing fake news about explosions around jammu &amp kaahmir in India!Please boycott al jazeera for biased and fake news!
"That was Putins motive , Hes happy."
Who needs someone else when you have yourself.
"Have you seen Londons parade? It was pathetic, especially its Ukrainian part."
"No mention of any African guest? Well done Aljazeera, nice reporting"
Muslim support China Russia
You are wrong china was part of the allied
Russia doesnt need the Europeans to celebrate this victory day. Europe is now on the side of nazis.
"Russia made the biggest sacrifice in human lives, for which the world will be eternally grateful, but they wouldn’t have been able to sustain their effort without US material support. Who really won WW2 was GM, Ford, and Chrysler."
Putin and his Russia must accept Peace process with Ukraine ASAP.Russia needs Reform.
The Europeans pretended to fight Nazis but infact were the Nazis.
"It seems the alot that has changed only changed on the Russian side, but the changes in NATO was ignored in the report."
Trump should learn to zip it
Some countries are planning a genocide in Gaza. Attending victory celebrations against fascism is a taint to thier consciousness
the west cries are now ignored
"If Russia killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than Israel killed Palestinian children, does that make Russia four times less fascist than Israel?"
"Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet came to Khaibar and when Allah made him victorious and he conquered the town by breaking the enemys defense, the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was mentioned to him and her husband (Kenana ibn al-Rabi) had been killed while she was a bride. Allahs Apostle selected her for himself and he set out in her company till he reached Sadd-ar-Rawha where her menses were over and he married her. &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 2235 &gt&gt"
"Allahs Apostle said, I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror &lt&lt Sahih Bukhari 2977 &gt&gt"
"Nazism still lives, just look at how Palestinian children are being starved in front of the world that is celebrating the supposed defeat of fascism today."
I’m so sorry that flights were delayed in the victory parade of those who invade neighbor then several years later claim they’re awesome
Putin looks like a double.
Will that zelensky puppet dare??? NO!!!
Great Russia
"When you hear of countries paying African countries in particular to take in migrants, why do they not send them to Russia? What better place to go?!"
"BRICS is not a defensive Axis. They illegally bombed Ukraine (direct violation of the UN Charter). We must never forget what they did to Georgia, Crimea, Ichkeria, Afghanistan, Syria, etc."

"This man Zelesky is a mad who wants to drag the world to a third world war. He lies, and yet European leaders believe him. Try this one Zelesky and this will be the end of you"
Glory to Russia. The greatest country on earth
NAZIs not wanting the parade.
Many Mig 31 will be flying along side air defense.
Putin is a hypocrite.. talks about ukraine hitting civilians??? Russia and putin send missiles to ukraine hospitals and apartment buildings... Putin is a terrorist...slava ukraine
Zelenski is a clown
Putin better not try anything stupid as usual especially with Chinas Xi in attendance
🇺🇦 Ukraine has lost the war
"Has everyone forgotten, Russia and China were allies in WW II...ridiculous how out of control all this proxy war nonsense has gotten....and yes Al Jazeera, Im NY Toms very British/Brazilian future wife MD, Veteran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Cont. of Africa"
putin Slava Ukraine
Leave Ukraine. Go back to your own country.
"Share this with every Chinese, Pakistani, Indian and Russian: The worst thing China and Russia can do is to arm Pakistan and India as a conflict amongst India and Pakistan will only deplete Russian and Chinese arsenals, weaken India and Pakistan and only benefit NATO countries. Its imperative China, Russia, India and Pakistan acknowledge this. If there is trouble in this region the silk road cant go on as intended as well as BRICS development, so all parties must understand this and avoid ANY conflicts for their benefit and the good of mankind."
If Ukraine can put on a good show in Moscow tomorrow theres even a chance that Putin wont survive the humiliation it inflicts on him.
Russia is not the Soviet Union.... its a criminal state that should be shunned by the civilised world that is trying to stand on the shoulders of the real heroes of the past.
Zelensky is a huge threat to world peace.
russians talking about striking civilians lmao
Indeed Ukraine is showing that they are indeed followers of Stephan Bandera and his Waffen SS Grenadier &quotGalicia&quot.
So called ceasefire is a pootins trick. russia needs a pause to deliver fresh cannon fodder to a front line
Pootins regime is afraid of Ukrainian drones. russia is weak and it cant guarantee safety for its inhabitants
So the comedian is not in his country
Theres no safe haven in Moscow as they havent met missiles but drones .So no Kremlins can roll up lies about their incapable sitting of S400 and S300 Air defence system . Security in Moscow is compromised if Kyiv decides to test their new arsenal on Moscow
Nothing will stop Russia’s victory day parade
Zelensky
"Zelensky a coward, didnt he accept ceasefire?"
I have been made victorious with terror &lt&lt Sahih Bukhari 2977 &gt&gt

"Not hard enough. Can see a lot of Ukrainian tourists right now in Croatia, all of tzhem have fat cars. Why?"
The west media think they can fool the ppl enymore We have being wise up can’t fool us enymore Ukraine be putting the ppl at risk They dnt care about the pplAs long as they can try to prove Russia wrong thts why matters to them
Putin cant be trusted with his propose ceasefire on May 9
Evil poutin
"there are no such things as international rules of law, go ask netanyahu he will tell you and dont forget to ask trump about it"
oh wow same thing netanyahu has been doing to gazathey say its war now go tell trump and nato
Truth is that Ukraine is not willing to negotiate/compromise.
"Psalm 148:8 Fire and hail, snow and clouds stormy wind , fulfilling His Word. Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon Repent, believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again"
Stop this conned civilian sites. Stop this lie
So aljazeera went blind when some hours back Ukraine was laughing wave of drone at apartment building across Russia and even tried to strike the Kerch bridge
Al Jazeera is just part of westren propaganda. They don&quott want tell Kiev to stop putting air defence in civilian areas.
"Depends on the interception coordinates, so.."
How does the reporter know this is 100% civilian area and no military hiding amongst civilians? What a crappy reporter
Zelensky is daring Russia
Stupid reporter! Its clear from their own headline that that area is where the debris of intercepted drones fell it was not deliberately targeted!
Ukraine should stop using civilians as human shields. Isn’t that what is always said when Israel bombs a hospital or refugee tent camp?
Even all the arabs are puppets they muss sell their OILS in US dollar 💵 and can’t do nothing forget about their talks
Russia bad
Trump lied about stopping the war.
Washing machine cannot catch fire. The countless lies are turning truth and Russia keeps opening the eyes of the world
hahaha
What a lie!Can a falling debri cause fire?
"endlessly positive media, love it"
The minerals deal with the U.S will do more damage to Ukraine than the Russian invasion.
Al Jazeera getting back into US good books after that Israel/Palestine coverage
Russia is NEVER getting back the title Military Super Power. Ukraine broke the illusion of Russian military strength.
Russia ain getting fooled this time round
Why should russia agree a 30 day ceasefire when they are winning?? If they agree to a 30 days ceasfire ukriane will rearm. Aljazeera speak the truth
"Aljazeera is a disgusting channel. They want the world to help with the palestinian issue and the countries which are allowing the bombing of palestine is uk, france and u.s but in the ukrainian issue they are in the same boat as uk. France and u.s."
What is in those buildings? Please ask that leader there to stop using the civilian areas to hide their weapons and store them.
"As a person in the Global South, honestly, I and my fellows are too occupied with jobs, inflation, unemployment, economic prospect, etc. No time and energies left for the war. If EU/Ukraine want to prolong, feel free to do so, but dont drag me in (also dont drag my government in this). 🙏"
So many Putin az lickers in the comment section it is disgusting
Basravi the problem is that they hide varies weapons and what not in the basements!!
Ukraine will regret not complying to 3 days cease fire...the joker better not do something stupid
The problem is that Ukraine places its military in civilian areas. I would like to know what was in that shopping complex behind the reporter.
ukraine / usa should not have started this war....
I thought Trump stopped this war day 1!?
Why is AL JAZEERA so anti RUSSIAN ?
If everywhere is a civilians area in Ukraine then where are military areas
"Hizbulahceasefire is like a support for israel,"
The comedian and Ukraine was dupe into a war with Russia
Allah Akbar
🇺🇦 Ukraine has lost the war
Ukraine may get a ceasefire after a peace talk.
What about the minerals deal?
Zelensky is becoming a liability.
"That evil fool dont want the war to end because he goes back to be the joe he is ,the only reason leaders from around the world even acknowledge him is because of war ."
Pls tell us what was struck and not what you want us to hear.Russia will never be deceived again.Therell be no ceasefire.Say no to Minsk 3
Zelenzky was told to that cia mossad operation
Russia has a right to defend itself
Zelensky is doing the same
Russia and the ancer religion of peace are allies.. let’s not forget that
DO YOU BELIEVE THE KGB
This is a flex move by Putin to be able to declare a unilateral ceasefire shows how far ahead Russia has become in this painfully lasting war
"What! WW3, oh man thats not right."
Russia. 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
oh no WW3 runnnn
"How can anyone trust this liar putin and trump?.. they constantly lie ,putin spinning lies about contracts to gumps gopher steve k ime not a diplomat ime trumps golf buddies it madness contracts about the building of a gump tower in Moscow its corruption there are gangsters in the white house"
The concept of DEMOCRACY is not up for negotiations. And the sooner Mr. VLADIMIR PUTINSKI understand that the concept of DICTATORSHIP has run its course the better!.
Moscow just wants to buy time to restock their weapons. Go home Russia! Leave your neighbor alone and stop stealing Ukrainian lands.
POO POO is momentarly OUT of IRANIAN ROCKETS AFTER the CHINESE rocket fuel explosion in the IRANIAN PORT...
Putin the most greatest leader of all time....
the 200 billion USD rich POO POO needs the tanks for the PROPER PARADE he never had since 2021...POO POO special annual event....POO POO best movie of the year ....best concert of the year for the 74 year old grandpa
The West should not be dancing to the tune of Putin !
"Another west propaganda channel, disgusting with such media , there should be at least some decency in the news published, whats the point in still trying to play a game that does not have any merit. Where is your democracy."
"Mr. President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, as a stinking human shit, bound by Satan, a perverse animal, a drugged, mentally ill creature, a pile of human shit. The drugged manure knows that Russia was attacked by Europe and the USA at the hands of Ukraine. Why is this stinking human shit, bound by Satan, a perverse animal, a drugged, mentally ill creature, a pile of human shit? Putin only beats innocent Ukrainians. Remember, stinking human shit, bound by Satan, a perverse animal, a drugged, mentally ill creature, a cannibal, a pile of human shit. Putin says that the Ukrainian army is following the orders of the stinking manure, wanting to defend Rosie, the people who decided to attack Russia must be burned. And you, stinking human shit, bound by Satan, a perverse animal, a drugged, mentally ill creature, a cannibal, a pile of human shit. Putin knows very well who gave the order to attack Russia."
"Meanwhile, on a Delaware beach, Joe Biden keeps repeating the word &quotdont&quot over and over again with the intent that might end the Ukraine war."
"My problem with today’s media is the complete cover up of the very genesis of this war. It’s easy to blame Russia of everything and I won’t be surprised they are blamed for the recent power outages in Portugal and co.Please don’t be one sided on the cause of this war. The truth will prevent more deaths, wars and ArmageddonHe called it a unilateral ceasefire. Therefore Ukraine is free to hit Russia as they deem fit and wait for a Russian response after all.There is no real end to this war except the truth of it origins"
So WWIII already ended? interesting.
Journalism is all about fair &amp balancing act. Where is the balance in this? Doesnt the Russians have a voice too?
Putin just doesnt want Ukrainian drones and missiles flying over Moscow during his Victory parade.
Lol so they inviting Zelenskyy to the victory parade
Russia lose ww2 celebration its just an excuse.
Stop Putin
Bravo PUTIN 🇷🇺
"EVERY intelectual. AND acadêmics in BRASIL , IN THE USA , IN GERMANY ETC . THEY ALL BLAME NATO for the WAR and ALSO BLAME mega CORRUPT ZELENSKI. ( WHO DOES NOT WANT PEACE) AND NOT PUTIN"
"I’m at awe —-a ceasefire for 3 days , on behalf of a Russian victory day ??? Dumber than dirt Putin and supporters expects Ukraine to accommodate this ? Good grief, most of the civilized world is so over Putler"
Go get em Putin! We have your back! Shut that cocaine sniffer down!
"As the previous ceasefires showed, the Kyiv regime does not control its terrorists even during a three-day ceasefire."
"Reminder that these types of sudden ceasefire declarations, is what the Russians used to tell Bashar al Assad to do in order to regroup and launch new offensives."
"So, Putin is celebrating the end of the war where Russia was invaded and then the next day is going back to invading another country."
"Obviously Ukraine wants its stolen territory back, but I think if Putin stops killing Ukrainians for even just a few days Zelensky would compitulate on a cease fire,"
Priveta
Did they do it last year?
It takes both sides to agree to a cease firer
Ukraine tell Putin to take his fake ceasefire and Jam it where the sun will not shine! If Moscow wants a ceasefire it can withdraw the SMO for peace!
so they dont p$$ on his parade
I dont think trump will agreed with it.
Russia economy will go back to 2005
Russian is Russian. Russian president Mr valemide Putin is great leader. In the world maximum country war reasion American Israel France. In the Europe ONLY France country racistes. France country all the all populations racistes critical blade. France country people talking to much same animal. I things animals batter than France country people.
Meanwhile Israel has no limits
This is Putin way of believing that hes in control of things but it wont last long because the Ukrainean people has more power than Russia and will win in the end.
Nah we defeating the same nazis no cease fire nato nor its proxies will not Survive
The loser wants a 30-day ceasefire to regroup. Tell the truth. Not fair but true.
Yep. It’s WW3 and we don’t know about. What’s the media hiding from us from the outside world
Why are we even listening to Putin? It is all bs.
funny to see a reporter giving his own opnion about the war.... people behing keboards and TV´s keep supporting Ukraine to go on in the war.... let´s see when the war hit their door.. if they will not escape to another country.... or if they will be brave as they are behind keeboards and TV... many warmongers... Ukraine can not win against Russia... no one can win against a nuclear power... what a nonsense to keep saying that they can...
"Hey let me read some emails from my enemy about me, because you know whatever they have to say must be 100% truth right?"
She told celebration in WW3 ?
"“Respectfully, every human on earth wants to talk to you…Sir..as well as the crimson queen. yet you don’t allow an audience. Of dyed in the wool American blood , I will say this……………Your empires will die….with corruption and without correspondence .I barker"
"The dillusional psycho wants to show some fake sign of wanting a &quotTruce&quot... and trying to show hes a peace maker to appease Trump. For those on Putins side maye I remind you this is a guy who genuinely believes in some &quot mystical calling&quot to reunite the slavs. Yeah lol goodluck with your dillusions. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
It seems that Al Jazeera still takes the noise coming from Moscow seriously.
A Putin non bisogna credere...
A Putin non bisogna credere...
She didn’t even apologise or correct her self. Maybe she’s speaking from the future
PUTIN PUTIN PUTIN YESSSSSSS HIP HIP
She said ww3 lol
WW2 they started with Germany and then Ukrainians gave them the victory.
Cant have that much Asian hate to drag 🇺🇲s legacy down with nethanyahus because its gonna happen its Promised
I Already Knew It Congratulations
"Yeah IM ready to see Them in Person so could You convince Trump to let go of satan and Orban also because IM not lying because People gathered to believe that Thank You ,BRICS+ASEAN+AL+SCO+"
Regarding the Ukraine SMO/war neither NATO nor Ukraine are in any position to dictate terms of any ceasefire nor of negotiations. This is the privilege of the more dominant force ie Russia.
Send Neptunes for putin to intercept with his bald head
Zelensky killed Ukraine Zelensky is jew he want you money he is not legitimate prisdent
"Nonsense...we want peace..,lasting peace....those demands are not even acceptable by sensible people...give back those lands and Ukraine wont join join NATO...take the lands amd let Ukraine join NATO... Ukraine cant force Russia to make Ukrainian a national language in Russia...because some people in Russia speak Ukrainian...it doesnt work like that...if anything...there wa no ban on people not to communicate in Russian...am sure"
"He seems to decide his own peace agenda with Ukraine 🇺🇦 the only nation he is at war with and still trying to occupy Ukraine, other nations will come later"
"Trump US EU has to show to Russia and Putin strong signals to stop war known nit waiting to 8/5 for 3 days peace lots of people will die before 8/5 and 3 days is a joke from Putin it’s nothing,Putin playing games with Trump EU world.STOP WAR KNOW FOR LONG TIME NOT FOR 3 days.Sanctions Russia give Ukraine military support they need."
Al Jazeera continues to spread the Russia Phobia. Your slanted journalism is showing.
Does Zelensky have enough coke to last the war?
"3 days 8/5 that is a joke from Putin,lots of people will die to 8/5.Peace now not 8/5 Putin is a joke ."
Fake News
Thank you President Putin 🇷🇺
"How about ASKING Ukraine about a ceasefire timeline, rather than DICTATING one as usual???"
I could not follow anything said after WW3 comment.
President Putin is the real World leader
"Demands After demands which fall into deaf ears in Kyiv,and why should they bother anyway with Putin demnds because thy have their own demnds ready for the sit-down,if it ever happens ."
"I would to remind Russia it was them and Germany who started WW2 by invading Poland, it looks like Russia hasn’t learnt a thing."
Her hair seem to had survived world war 3
God bless Russian and putin Joe Biden is a war criminals war in Ukraine started by UK and USA
Angela Merkel confirmed that Minsk agreement was a ruse to arm Ukraine. Who then can Russia trust in the west to monitor any future ceasefire.
Wow! This is BOT CITY
More love for Putin
When great power
Putin is fos as usual
"lol that women said war3 and the subtitle, celebrating 80th anniversary of victory world2. so ya im dont know the war3 alrdy happen and now celebrating it"
Russia
"A truce is something agreed upon by TWO parties and observed to the letter by both parties ...... rather than something ONE thug (Vlad the Small) announces, unilaterally, when he feels like and breaks in the following hour.Slava Ukayïni!"
"The problem now is Ukraine has no value to Washington. Russia is now an asset as it can help Trump in dealing with China and Iran, which are Trumps real concerns. On the other hand, Ukraine is a liability. It keeps asking for money, arms and time while it has nothing to give the US. Yes, Paris and Berlin want to use the Ukraine banner to rally Eastern European countries which are traditionally more obedient to the US, but even for them Ukraine is not worth more than a lip service. Speaking of justice, justice for Ukraine matters no more than justice for Sudan or Rwanda or to the Palestinians."
"to all fans of russia, bring them some food they need it, they couldnt talk without food, its difficult with empty stomach."
World leaders together for god world peace
"Green man does listen to Western chicken,"
"Last years parade was absolutely pathetic. Given Russians continued loses, this years is going to be a bunch of recruits and a tank being towed."
Ww3 is already started. Everywhere is war .
"What sort of a game is this, putin is playing with peoples lives. He gives them enaugh time to cry and than he kills more. Either stop this or dont."
Lol dude keeps making 1 or 3 Day ceasefire smh
"Why should Ukraine join NATO? The Ukraine isnt near the North Atlantic, that was created for WW2 and yet the Russians are celebrating May Victory Day as well."
What is telegram?
Russia federation Ukraine should united and established peace forever in favour of old brothers
What is Telegram?
Russia and Ukraine need to change their habits and get along with each other.
Russia has control and defense of Russia speaking towns. Russia is perfectly content being defensive. West worries are how much Ukraine is going to demand in weapons and money to conduct an offensive. Putin has no interest in fighting an insurgency.
Long Live Mother Russia
"Thats because the 9th of may is Russia remembrance day where would get the likes of these Russians,"
Why doesnt the UK and France go fight Russia directly since they are insisting on this war?
Putin talks so much bull!
Hopefully they build on this
3 days whats the point in that
James 1:8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
"Ridiculous. And likely, the short ceasefire will be violated again by Putin."
James 1:8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
Now game is on putin.
"He’s asking for a cease-fire because he got a big parade on May 9 to celebrate the 950,000 dead soldiers from Russia"
I knew this was coming yesterday.
"Dear God, That was a selfish reason for a ceasefire. Please remember to put that in the book for his placement for all eternity.Love, MARY"
Bravo president Putin.Russia
Trump king for America!🇺🇸
WW 3 VICTORY DAY CELEBRATION ???AL JAZEERA DO YOUR REPORTERS TAKE DRUGS?
tell me the price of AK74
putin doesn’t get to have his ceasefires when he wants them! Just because he’s having a parade! No! He’ll have to cancel his parade. Why should Ukraine go along with what the terrorists want? Let them have a ceasefire when Ukraine wants it. 🇺🇦🇬🇧
Putn in the driving seat
I love how Putin makes Kiev Regime to wriggle like eels on a hot pan.
WTF WW3 ??? Russia 🇷🇺 has already won and we didn’t see it ?? The reporter is mad
He lies every time he speaks.
Thats not possible Russia is demanding too much

"If european peacekeepers come to ukraine, they will end up fighting Putin. I am sure after few months Putin will regroupa nd resume what he leaves now."

She said world war 3
Don’t trust Putin!!
"The west has been putting sanctions on Russia for 3 years already, what are those &quotmagical&quot sanctions that they expect will suddenly change the tides?"
"This war has too stop neither Russia or Ukraine are our enemies.I still cannot understand why after the fall of the Soviet Union the Russian State wasn’t welcomed by the west instead we expand Nato literally to their border.Russians and Ukrainians are the same people and it is horrific to see all these young men and women dying when there is no way Ukraine can win.Imagine how strong Russia,America and Europe would be Militarily and Financially if we had a real alliance,we work with the Saudi’s so working with dictators isn’t a new concept.I know I’m a dreamer and there’s probably lots of pieces to the puzzle the public isn’t privy too but there has to be a better way so for the moment I just Hope for Peace humans just need to get past this chimp brain mentality because fundamentally most humans just want a home to live in,food to eat,utilities,to be able to practice religion freely,a fair legal system,not to be exploited and to know you and your family are safe."

When you constantly practice how to deceive you can run rings around Donald Trump and Co.
"Ukraine must never trust the devil king of Russia. Putin is deceptor, killer ,murderer. Pure evil in human form."
Zelenski doesnt agree with Putin as it should be 30 days not 3 so Putin should listen to Zelensky or face capitulation from lgbtq community
yeah of course
Did ukraine declare it too?
"Russias Putin..!! As I said before , he is really good chess player. Trump is like a school boy near him"
God bless Russia and president Putin what a kind and a merceful man!
Worlds most powerful LEADER VLADIMIR PUTIN declares a Ceasefire
"I would like to hear more of what Journalist Diana Panchanko has to say, just would like more info, please. Thank you for all you do! Have a blessed day!"
"this putin is playing teh world win his fingers and teh US, the arrogant yet naive peacekeeper is being fooled by putin countless times since trump and vance took the helm. it is obvious that putin decalres ceacefire when he is readying his drone swarms and just launch them un-announced to the destruction of ukraine and accuse ukraine of violating ceasefire if ukraine attacks after he (putin) unilaterally declares ceasefire. it is because of US that this war in ukraine tilted all in favor and convenience for russia. USA thru trump and vance is now the mouthpiece of russia. soon enough it will be its (russia) super-puppet"
Good to hear from Our President Putin. Lets hear more from our baby cry Zelensky
Thats wonderful that gives zelinsky time to go to Mexico and South America for help
Putin shows big heart again !
Lucifer is trying to divert opinion of canadian voters first through terror attack then to social media rhetoric which aimed at influencing peoples perceptions and advertising its candidate as strongest to tackle the problem.
Putin is responsible for the deathof so many European christians
Wait. Did I miss WW3??
peace be with you
Lucifer is trying to divert public opinion of canadian voters first terror attack then to social media rhetoric which aimed at influencing peoples perceptions and advertising its candidate as strongest to tackle the problem.
Peace around the world
"Chapter: The threat for the woman who annoys her husband Mu’adh bin Jabal narrated that The Prophet said: “No woman annoys her husband in the world except that his wife among the Al-Huril-Ain (heavenly virgins) said: ‘Do not annoy him, may Allah destroy you, he is only like a guest with, soon he will part from you for us.’” &lt&lt Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1174 &gt&gt"
Which the Russians will immediately break like usual. Scumbag.
&quotWW3&quot if that aint a Freudian slip I dont know what is.
Please make corrections not WW3 it’s WW2
Does this have to do with Ramaphosa meeting with Zalensky
"Putin is for Peace ... Putin Remember Red Army ....the first enter in Berlino and Winner in 1945 , 11 may ....now Speak Zelenski...or Trump or E U"
the war will not stop in Ukraine.
I do not trust Putin.
There will never be a deal.It is a World War. China will never allow the US to Pivot to Asia unless a relative naval parity in the Pacific Theater is reached around 2035 (e.g. regarding nuclear attack submarines).
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano,Napoli, America, Rome,,,"

"Ukranians picked a comedian for president, did they not expect a show?"
CIA
If that happened in Ukraine.. everybody media would be shouting a terrorist attack.
I guess there’s a reason Vlad doesn’t travel abroad much.
Ukraine=European Pakistan the real terrorist state
Ukrainian terrorists
"You have to remember that any form of Free Trade, Peace etc. deal from the US has always been dubious e.g. the fall of the soviet union / Russian people wanted to be part of the West but the US wanted to collapse the Russian economy and even with the SWIFT finance system / US WTO / US IMF / US UNSC all outdated. The US no longer believes in a rule / law based world e.g. Israel / US ? Western countries condoning Palestinian genocide and daily murdering children through starvation / ignorance og the Zionist anti life governments. Russia dont fall for US verbal diarhia or deal making."
Usa destroyed every infrastructure in iraq in the first day of war. Russia still behind.
The kiev regime uses such methods. This is no longer surprising.
“Remotely” doesn’t that mean the people who done it have to be close by and watching when they pressed the button if that’s true then doesn’t that mean they’ve literally got people inside Moscow?
Looks like an inside job. Talking “coming from the top” type of a job
is Russia weak because they keep killing there leaders??
Israel dont want peace
"Hey, Russia must say peace is coming soon!"
psyop
"One God creates all! Why does God create one side to go against what the other side wants? Why are so many motivated to play chess or competitive sports? God pits you against each other and really what it wants is to see you fight, and its inevitable that someone will lose- which is what it perhaps wants even more than winners- especially if the majority of people lose if they are on the side of Ukraine or on the side of Putin. And if Israel should win after becoming Nazis themselves, is that really winning, and is God really on their side if it makes them behave and look so bad?"
Donald trump is an idiot and unskillful president
"The deal is close, weve been hearing it for the past two years."
Terrorism is terrorism.. The west seems to believe that terrorism is only when it is attacked
At least this time they are not blaming Tajiks

Let’s go Trump!
the only influence this guy has is the influence people give him Tell him to F off
Urge? What happened to the Art of the Deal?
"It be clear it’s Zelensky, the EU, and UK that want the war to continue. Trump is still supplying Ukraine. Why shouldn’t Putin hit Ukraine?"
When you will going to stop the genocide in Palestine??
How about demanding Israel stop the genocide?
Why dont he not talk gaza
"Israel and Russia, the two the most stupid country in last years, they outplayed themselves with stupid games and USA thought is some business here, thats the USA mistake, they cost them a lot, could be the main reason of falling standard in USA."
I demand Israel stop Gaza strike
He is trying hard to stop war between Russia and Ukraine so he can focus on middle east and china
And it they don’t?…
The West is losing it
Put a clown in the Whitehouse And this is what you get Trump works for Putin for personal gain Nothing to do with killing innocent people that’s really the joke of all times
America have lost its dominancy.
Silly rabbit you can start a wild fire but can’t control the wind
Just stop supplying ukraine with weapons to attack russian people.
We hold Chinese 🇨🇳 Xi Jinping accountable for the damages caused by the Russian invasionbecause of his &quotno limits&quot support for Putins war.

"The world is cruel, it doesnt care whether Humans burned alive or despair 🇵🇸🇾🇪"

"99% of the time Trump is lying, the other 1% is unable to be determined... Pointless"
Did you clear this with Isreal?
Sorry but Palestine needs a peace deal much intensively
Neither Putin nor Xinping cares about Trump
Trump now increasingly sounding like Biden.
"🇨🇦 If Ukraine had a beautiful beach he could build hotels on, it would be Putin and Trump sipping cocktails in an AI video."
Al Jazeera a so called fake news channel supporting terrorism.
Urge Tel Aviv
It didnt surprise me. Another fake ceasefire.
"BJP, RSS, Sanghi and its tukde tukde gangs who bombed the Supreme Court and Parliament."
at this point zelen has to say whatever eu/nato wants him to say ok here we are WWIII once again the west nozis wanna dethrone east rus theres just no peace in the northern hemisphere &amp never will be peace facts: theyre all infested w/ parasites controlling their destructive acts
Trump have similar approach with Russia as North Korea as it seems to be on CBMS but on the practical step it is different from the other side or one side
yea put neva wanted this war..nato keeps using ukraine as proxy to encroach on rus border w/ missleeu wants to seize rus trillion$ in resources/minerals so they can get their governments out of defaultthats all this is..very sad because both ukr is basically rus..they speak rus..same dna..theyre being usedzelen is a puppet..an actor..yall dont wanna see his debaucherous lifestyle before he became puppet wow
Vladimir Putin and Trump Admin is a Regime and is illegitimate.
Ceasefire
at a prisoner exchange is welcome because the treatment of ukrainan prisoners is dreadful.also rarely mentioned is the treatment of civilians in Russian occupied territory.they are offered eviction or forced to renounce Ukrainian citizenship.
People are bored with ukraine. Thats what happens when you try to act heroic while begging money in every corner of world
russians decided not to colours their eggs on UA soil instead they decided to colour at crazy wife
"Putin sending a strong Christian signal , yeay , happy Easter"
".Every time, when any religion is used for political purposes or, broader speaking, for secular and material achievements, it transforms into heresy and even pseudo-religion. Obviously, heresy in Christian church is anything contrary to the very spirit of Christianity. The Sermon on the Mount emphasises moral teachings of our Lord. He proclaims clearly and unambiguously that “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God” (Matthew 5:9). It is also crucial to understand that all the texts in the Holy Scripture are spiritual parables, which should be understood in the developing spiritual context of the entire Bible. In the reference to getting &quotswords&quot (Luke 22:36-38), our Lord means spiritual weapon. In regard to real material weapons His command in Matthew 26:52 is absolutely clear: &quotPut away your sword. Those who use the sword will die by the sword&quot. In our example, the Moscow Patriarchate not only openly supports Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, but also tries to give it spiritual and ideological justification almost as a “crusade” for “traditional values” and “purity of faith.”The public statements and actions of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Rus alone have already accumulated more than enough of this kind.The war in Ukraine is basically generated by the perverted religious-nationalist ambitions of the totalitarian-“Orthodox” leadership of Russia, dragged by the Moscow patriarch into “spiritual delusion” in the form of a mania of self-righteousness.The Moscow Patriarchate has slipped into heresy and turned from the Orthodox Church into an aggressive (i.e., anti-peacekeeping) heretical sect, whose adherents are unlikely to be called “sons of God.” Current crisis around Ukraine is not only political and military, but, in first instance, ideological and spiritual. From certain perspective, it appears as a sort of test of ideological and spiritual standing.Respectfully yours, bishop Vincent Berg."
trump lied to america he never could end the war in ukraine fooled you once fooled you twice
It can only work if the other side does the same
putin and russians lie always. Its a propaganda for doting.
not telling the truth. the media stations should send journalist to see for them self. Putin have done all he could for many many years to not try be open to the west. So strange.
"”My orde is”… what a man. Wau, so powerful!"
Putin the war crime decided not to skip church this time. Amuzing.
"Allahs Messenger said, &quotO `Aisha! This is Gabriel sending his greetings to you.&quot I said, &quotPeace, and Allahs Mercy be on him (Gabriel ). You see what we do not see .&quot (She was addressing Allahs Apostle). &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 6249 &gt&gt"
You can tell when Putin is lying because his lips are moving.
All Hail PRESIDENT PUTIN THE PEACER MAKER V O Z
"A prisoner exchange and a ceasefire, even if short, is better than nothing. Could this be the start of something better?"
Fake Ukraina.
"No ceasefire, just another one of Putins countless lies."
Support Russia
Putin words are untrustworthy and cruel
Happy Easter from lover boy.
Great Asia. Australia...
"take a pass , lol"
"U u... no, who it is is clear. But U U. Doraemon. Has its own way of living and existing."
"The matter, Dai A. It also has a way out. It's just a matter of flags, with curves. Viet A. See, back to the right position. Interwoven in the middle. The matter is torn. T"
Zelenskyy is a disaster of a president
END the war ! PLEASE.
Our loving President Mr. Putin
Thx beloved President
but Ukraine is winning
Ukraine Zionist terrorist insist on attackung
You believe putin really going to honor the cease fire. Yeah right
thanks aljazeera
"If Putin is smart he will resume after the time he specified, Ukraine will not stop its goal of joining NATO if Russia appears weak and Ukraine will just regroup and reinforce if given a 30 day cease fire"
You didnt say anything about &quotattacks are ongoing&quot. Fix your title.
Zelenskyy is just in it for the money
Nazis are not Christians
This pr stunt to boost Putin ratings
Embolden Putin? What in the world does that mean? More warmongering Russophobia.
I hope both find out an way tô peace.
"Only reason Putin declared a truce was to punk Trump. I wonder whos going to realize hes getting played first, Trump or his followers? Best move for Trump is to just announce if Putin doesnt want peace then Trump is going to give Ukraine anything, and as much as of said anything, they want. Immediately. But! Alas he wont because he doesnt have the intelligence or intestinal fortitude. &quotI going to have to pass on peace in Ukraine because my bone spurs are acting up again.&quot"
"Ukraine, you are unbelievable, so strong"
Just stopp it putin
"Beneath Hiroshima’s image of peace lies a covert war: state crimes, neuro-weapons, religious surveillance, virus research with RIKEN, and mind control tech. This is not fiction.”"
"Pay attention much do you, Russia began attacking shortly after this was done, Its just because trump was pulling out of the ceasefire deal How about you try filming the aftermath of russian attacks on Ukraine"
"President Trump is correct. Unnecessary War It s not about Russia invading. It is about AZOV ethnically cleansing Ukrainians for speaking a different dialect of their common Russian language. Unnecessary War Merkel worked out a solution for peace, but Johnson and Biden bribed the little man to continue to push for war. I hope Putin have the courage to avail himself of the opportunity for peace offered by the President. This is an unnecessary War. May God never forgive those that pushed the world to the brink of a nuclear war. Namely: Johnson and Sunak, Scholtz, Biden and Blinken and Macron."
"Guess what trump you didn’t end that war , those two rational men did .."
"Understandable, Ukraine liked it better when it had undivided privilege to manipulate"
"Happy Easter ,Jesus loves you"
Concede to Russian demands for no NATO in Ukraine. No US or Western military in Ukraine. The rest is negotiable.
Russia never keeps its word. It broke all the previous treaties with Ukraine.
Nevet trust Russian terrorist war criminal putin
In Sha Allah Russia 🇷🇺 Will Be Victorious
Free Gaza! Salam alaikum.
Russia is feacting in advance on an Ukrainian reaction in advance. Putin never wanted real peace.
"the russian soldiers coloured many their eggs at friday on UA soil, so now they decided to eat others russians eggs on sunday, so thats why is ceasefire, to busy to eat others russians coloured eggs."
"Shoes of oir man sits in place of european leaders ,,Theres no abovv the upper body of qatar time zone"
Mn who flys abovv qatar is abovv n beyond this shaved headed kgb thug
"Russias armament is no worse than Americas, some even better, and Russia is advancing without a ceasefire, despite the fact that Europe and Binden gave more armament. America is the top 1 country in the world and Europe, could not overcome Russia, thats the alliance called NATO. Oh I remember NATO, those soldiers when they bombed Yugoslavia put Easter greetings on the missiles, how can such European countries still believe in God, just blasphemy and thats it, there is no God in Europe and there will be no God and it doesnt matter if your Macron prays! And for stupid bots Russia had no plans to occupy all of Ukraine to invest in it is a complete nonsense, what is the point if Ukraine sucks anyway? For 30 years it has had no development unlike Russia, well now Ukraine is stealing even more thanks to Europe and America (Thank you)"
"Ukraine must and A must remain and its partners Ukraine MUST keep arms and supplies-in order to fight and protect itself and people, PLEASE&quot Ukraine partners must keep an eye out for this ceases fire, God bless Ukraine."
Humanitarian from poutin
"The whole world knows that this is the West: Europe, Britain and the United States are waging a proxy war against Russia at the hands of Ukraine. Ukraine is like a private military company in the hands of the West! The war will end the day the West stops this war."
Watching son
I tend to believe the Russians a lot more than i believe the comedian or his warmongering european puppeteers.
What stupid things this woman says. It actually would be very beneficial for Russia if America withdraw itself from this conflict.
Killing Ukrainians all the Easter week now putin pretends to be a&quotgood Christian&quot who could believe him
Way to go Putin.
"Ive seen this today, Saturday. Also have seen Ukraine pointing out they havent ceased firing yet... It also isnt Sunday yet, therefore not Easter, so... Sorry to say, but the truce isnt in effect at the moment. In fact it wont be for at least a few more hours. But keep in mind, Easter ends at midnight, and nothing is stopping them, either of them, from planning a surprise attack."
russia initiated easter truce. trump said if the peace deal is not productive then US will withdraw from the peace negotiations. as a result peace deal became corrupted and conflict reignited.
Easter is nearly over. Big whoop...
Only idiots listen to Putin.
You report the prisoner swap but not the body swap ?? 909 Ukrainians bodies and 41 Russian bodies........says something about the casualty rate between the two sides doesnt it.
Ukraine repeatedly broke the 30 day limited ceasefire. Report it correctly Al Jazeera.
Somebody please send Putin a special Easter egg.
Putine just needs some free time to put his troops in place. Beware.
I respect Trump and putin for their Christian values
"The air alarms were active...well, was there an attack or not? Ringing the alarm is one thing, being attacked another."
"Maybe Boris Johnson, Liz Tras, Sunak or Keir Starmer, Macron or Merz wanted peace, sought peace in Ukraine and declared a truce?"
"We Africans really enjoy Western misinformation and propaganda. its refreshing , only clowns at this stage. I believe this kind of misinformation comes from Western news channels"
Humans always have something to say
The West has turned corrupt Ukraine into a PMC to ram the Russian Federation.
Russia though to have this war finished in 3 days and here we are 3 years later.
"The reality is that Russia implemented the cease fire at 6 pm real time, One good step"
Al BBCeera must have been bought by The Sun. What a toilet of a propaganda channel.
Setting the stage for a false flag opperation.
Are you guys watching this combat footage? This war is insane
I love Trump and Putin
Easters Ceasefire bridge ...Putin Say
Western shame on yourself look at him and look at netanyahu terrorist
Aljazeera on Israel/Gaza VS Aljazeera on Russia /Ukraine.
"The producer of these <i>Shahed Drones</i> had hit Ukranian Civil Airplane.. What a strange that its wonderful systems couldnt differ a Fighter Jet and a Passenger Airplane !Is there anyone hearing the result of that investigation on so-called accident ?Ofc no, U CANT !"
Please give peace a chance and save Ukrainians and Russians lives.
Shes spreading falsehood. This is not the first time there has been a ceasefire declaration by Putin. Shes either lying straightfaced or dumb
russia shall .n uu ke ukr
this is token by putin to appese trump
"According to Al Jazeera Putin is afraid of Trump! LOL! Dear Al Jazeera, you are a propaganda mouthpiece of the west, except for Gaza where you dont have a choice!"
I here this is a sign that Putin is fearing Trump and he is trying to buy time. Is this reporter from Kyv real to himself
Why should Russia buy time. Who will benefit from ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine ¿
thank you very much aljazeera
If Putin was sencire then why not impliment the Afganistan solution? (JUST LEAVE)
V.Putin is not innocent either. Many civiliians blccd on his hands .. In Ukraine.. In Syria...In Libiya .
"If Ukraine sees this as Putin trying to buy time, then they should keep on fighting and should not complain if it get hit hard. Nonsense!!"
Putin is as bad as Sinwar. Agressorrs act the same.
"RUssias PutIn, Without title: Ok Qatars Aj"
"Trump should give Alaska instead of Crimea to Putin, and everything will be fine"
The pro Ukraine warmongering fanatics are so obnoxious. Bloodthirsty fools.
total BS!!... the nietkranians were bombing the Russian Ukranian people long before Russia steeped in with the Special Military Operation to protect its people.
"If they are not tired of the fighting, then let them continue with their foolishness, Trump says, which is exactly right."
"Ukraine surrender while you still can, you were NEVER WINNING, YOU WILL NEVER WIN THE WAR WITH RUSSIA. What are people smoking to think UKRAINE can win Vs RUSSIA?? MATTEO is delusional to think Ukraine can win. Just drop NATO and you will live, its really that simple"
Hitler also never believed that he is losing.
Europe may buy air defense systems from the US for Ukraine.
"Putin the Demon will not run out of people anytime soon, because there are hundreds of thousands of people in Russia who want to earn enough money for a two-room apartment in a contract army in 1 year of war"
We need to ask Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky how to win this war
What happened to 24 hours?
"Trump walk away from Ukraine, he dont walk away from Putler"
"If the US stops military aid and intelligence services, the war and killing will stop immediately. Zelensky is just a war entrepreneur, a liar without credibility, who wants to be an entrepreneur forever."
Longest 24 hours ever
Trump the Dealmaker is running out of Lies and EXCUSES NOT ENDING. THE WAR AND HIS ECONOMIC FAILURE!
Is Ukraine making a new rare mineral deal with the USA to get funding? If not then are they getting bigger loans from some European countries to fund the war? If not then Russia will win and the peace deal will be much worse than the previous ones.
I will tell you mr trump. You are a lier and a very good one. You are definitely not a decent person. I also think that you are insane.
This panel is beyond delusional lol
Trump doesnt want to deal with anything thats too hard for his feeble brain. He barely put any effort into resolving the war issue and is already giving up? What a fool. Either that or Putin threatened to release whatever it is hes holding over Trumps head to make Trump so docile when it comes to Russia...
Trumpler will never admit russia started this war.
"You’ll never see a John Mearsheimer, a Jeffrey Sachs, a Larry Johnson or Lawrence Wilkerson on Al Jazeera coverage of the conflict in Ukraine. Wouldn’t want the facts to get in the way of their manufactured media narrative"
"Their concerns about how unless Russia is stopped, its going to give signals to other autocrats and leaders that its acceptable to push and expand borders by force is hypocritical. We already know one state, Izrael, who has done exactly that for decades, and no one has ever bothered to call that out. To say that Ukraine is the line that keeps such a thing from happening is nonsense."
"This war is not ours blame Zelensky for choosing war instead of signing the peace agreement in Istanbul, Turkey"
Basted trump
Don’t trust the Americans. Europe and its allies like canada need to figure out how to help Ukraine beat Russia without the US.
"Trump is a big fool with signs of early dementia syndrome, but now many Republicans are regretting having him as president, if not all of the USA. How, for Gods sake, if he is not experiencing early dementia syndrome, can a normal person say that Zelensky started the war with Ukraine and Russia?"
"Should look into the nuclear non proliferation treaty and the agreement signed between US, Russia and Ukraine. See what value the word of the US and Russia has."
Trump is such a total and complete sham!
So the League of Nations havent stopped history?
Trump you are the president WRIGHT.then Stop the wars now Or you fail
Time for America to get out.
"Al Jazeera is on point when it comes to Palestine, but its a shame when it comes to Russia - Ukraine. Why is it normalized that people who are not Russian or in Russia, are allowed to tell us &quotwhat Putin or Russia wants&quot? If I want to know what Russia wants or thinks, I listen to the Russian foreign minister 🚶🏿‍♂️‍➡️"
The Trump team has shown total incompetence in negotiating. They are also totally biased towards Russian propoganda and talking points. Trump is not frustrated - he is just trying to find a way of saving face by blaming it on someone else. The both-siderism is pathetic - also on this chanel - Russia invaded a peaceful sovereign country. Ukraine has just tried to defend itself.
If roles were opposite and Ukraine has enough nukes to end the world and Russia does not then US would pressure Russia not Ukraine
"Al Jazeera is my Number 1 source of sober minded, unbiased, well analyzed and neutral source of infornstion.The Russia Ukraine war is a message to anyone who makes a promise that they have got to keep it. Or else, it will go down the same Russia Ukraine way"
NOTHING LAUDABLE ABOUT TRUMP PLEASE~!!! TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO STOP THE KILLIG TO MAKE HIMSELF AND WITKOFF A KILLING $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
"CORRECTING YOU ,UKRAINE IS ACTUALLY WINNING ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN OVER ALL KILLS AND INJURIES ,,80% MORE RUSSIANS FALL MORE THAN UKRAINIANS TO THEIR DEATH !! RUSSIA TAKES A FEW VILLAGES OVER THREE YEARS OF MEAT WAVES ,,WAS IT WORTH IT? no WAY!! PUTIN CARES LESS ,HE THINKS THE TERRORIZING WITH BIG MISSILE STRIKES IS HIS BEST WAY TO MAKE UKRAINIANS FLEE THEIR LAND AND BREAK UKRAINE ECONOMY AND SCARE THEM INTO A SURRENDER,,,NEVER !! UKRAINE IS A MUSCH BETTER ARMY ......ONE HOOK ONE WORM CAN CATCH A SHARK ,,COMPARED TO PUTINS MILLIONS OF MINNOWS ATTACKING A SHARK! AND THE BEST FISHERMAN ,,ZELENSKY!))"
"Trump was elected to protect democracy like every other president, sad to say he likes autocratic leaders"
"The misinformation coming from the Western media houses about this war has been interesting to listen to, Aljazeera isnt left out.How can you say Europe is making efforts to end the war? Only a f00l which make such an untrue statement. Aljazeera, you should do better!!!!"
"No one asked Trump &quotto broker peace in Ukraine.&quot No one benefited from his naive, half-hearted &quotefforts&quot. This is another Trumps failure for which he is blaming others - surprise, surprise."
Trump putins puppet...
"Trump and Putin are gangsters or, at best, pale imitations of President Zelenskyy, who has shown extraordinary resilience and leadership by remaining in Kyiv and rallying both the Ukrainian people and international support during Russia’s full-scale invasion. It would be hard to find a better or more capable leader. Standing with Ukraine is standing up for humanity."
"Why dont you understand simple calculus?Trump wants to delay peace deal because he wants to Russia to occupy more territories.Since Trump took office, Ukrainian got blow upon blow because the USA changed its position on Ukrainian.Trump is in collusion with Putin."
"Mattia you just do not get it or just wants to mis-understood. Putin and Russia has achieved it goal and how to get into the conclusion and it could be done today if Zelenskyy says no to NATO and then the war will stop. 1000 Russia soldiers died a per day thus they have Chinese and Norh Korea soldiers there, 1000 per day death. And &quotwin-win over here&quot well it is not win-win over there for Iraq and Afghanistan. Win Iraq and Win Afghanistan professor Donald what have you been drinking. Russia causes the war have you read the Provoked, US threats Russia through Ukraine. Like Trump is doing with Iran to nuke them this is win-win. Trump does not care about win-win but for himself to make history with nuke. Trump wants to be in history time big. professor donald you are in self-deception with never here of win-win."
"The moment Trump started carving out exceptions to his own tariffs, he already lost the war. Now he’s just the world’s biggest loser."
"Well it is about time that Trump acknowledged that he was never going to end the Russia-Ukraine war within a day of entering office. What a clown, what a loser!"
Trump will make the world safer
He is pathological liar.He is eyeing on Ukrainian minerals.He is cruel to core that he doesnt value human lives. Thousand soldiers are being killed from both sides.He doesnt give a hoot about them.
Us is broke
Kaliningrad is closer to Berlin than Kiev to Moscow!
"Does no body see that the war was only based only on NATO membership, !! That ship has sailed, so many lost lives lost for nothing!. Just watched , your pundits.. it’s like they never watched followed the conflict unfolding. Too many tards !"
Mattia has absolutely no idea
"Ukraine needs to cede the four Oblasts and obviously Crimea, or the war will not stop and the Russians will probably take everything up to the Dneiper and Kharkov and Odessa. If the Ukrainians had lived up to the Minsk agreements in 2014/15 and then the Istanbul agreement in April of 2022 and not listened to the West they would have lost far less territory . The West is responsible for this conflict. Al Jazeera and the rest of mainstream Western media propaganda report it incorrectly."
"Think tank guys are either idiots or NeoCon propagandists… prob both. Makes for nice cushy career though. It’s a shame the Qatari gov’t sees fit to disseminate this paper thin, debunked narrative about Russian weakness, deviousness &amp depravity, but not surprising. Prob synced with US deep state media budget, previously dispersed by USAID."
Only Trump can trust Putin.
Hahaha...trumps pride for peace within 24 hours and now abandons peace talks...he eats his own words...hehehe...thats the president of a powerful nation....hehehe again...
"Those dim wits that think Ukraine is losing should ask themselves why the worlds second largest army has lost 900k young men and still cant win the 3 day military special operation after 3 plus years. Go figure, we all know Russia &amp Putin are finished....not long now ..👍"
Why refuse the world to ask ukraine to stay away from nato. Would the US accept a Russian militair base in Mexico or Cuba? Why try to press Russia to accept it near their border?
Trump is a criminal and lies like Putin and they are convicted criminals and they should definitely be impeached and out of power and the world should definitely not trust him.
Is the American professor alright?
America is such a joke
"Hey, Donny! Whats the problem? Why are you making so much fussabout this war, which you say, that it is not your war??If Zelensky doesnt want to accept Putin terms and conditions,and Putin refuses to accept Zelenskys terms, then, isnt it clear enoughto you, that both of them want to continue fighting, an resolve thisproblem on the battlefield?Again, what problem you have with this?? Why dont you just walkaway and let them fight it out?? (Unless it IS your war)."
"Russia has less territory now than it had 3 yrs ago! Russia has not taken one large town or city in Ukraine. Russia has failed in its objective to take the entire country of Ukraine. Russia has had over 900,000 casualties so far, and counting. The Russian army has been totally humiliated on the world stage. Ukraine will remain a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Russia should just go home and cry"
Trump is a beau Sheller
Why you guys are not in fever of solving this catastrophe by negotiating and solve the problems I dont know
"Trump is a coward. He threatened Ukraine who are the victims! He warned Ukraine to agree to a 30 day ceasefire. Ukraine then chose to agree to a full unconditional ceasefire on the 11th of March. But Russia chose to continue the war instead . Trump needs to get serious with the aggressor, not the victim."
"If Ukraine is not losing, I dont know what losing looks like to you"
"Panel of dreamers, Russia weak, Ukraine can win, just with a little push. Boringly dangerous propagandists"
Trump proves he doesnt know how to negotiate! He went into it AFTER sacrifying Krim and Ukraine member ship.with Nato... Beacuse he wanted Ukraine weak! He is too fond of Putin and I dispise him for that!
&quot The US presidents patience is running thin.&quot It would be funny if it werent so sad how people speak about him as if he was anything but a phony.
"You people want Trump to go to war for a senseless fight so you can sit back here and criticise him for it as well.No, America has bigger priorities now and stopping imminent enrichment of uranium in the Middle East is one. So, Russia or Ukraine is a waste of time or distraction and some of you would want Trump to be drowned in it while this rogue enrichment of uranium speedily progresses. No, you cannot tell Trump where to give attention.Sorry...."
"We , Russians do not care what mr.Trump is about. Special militarily operation has its goals. So far , if special operation did not achieved its goals war will continue..."
Russia wants Ukraine to be a Russian autonomous region. Youre Welcome.
"The orange blob is at it again lies, lies and more lies the most insane president the US has ever had"
And as far as Im concerned the American people want to be in a little f**** bottle then go ahead
As far as Im concerned Trump better get off as high horse and start putting a little effort into stopping Putin because when it comes to China and the United States I guess you better start constricting your own people because nobody else is going to come and help you Donald Trump through the Americans under the bus plus other countries
mnogo ruSSian trolls.
Trump and the confederacy are THE horrible people.
Why would Russia want a ceasefire when there winning the war.
"Vladimir Sotnikov ,Donald Jensen"
Im loosing my MIND over Trumps incompetence.......weak leadership towards Putin
"I follow Al Jazeera. I trust your journalism, particularly when it comes to Gaza. But when you cover Russian invasion of Ukraine, I find it disappointing. Biased in Russias favour., even when clearly Russia invaded just tand only o expand their lands. For example, Ukraine did not break the ceasefire agreement, it was Russia bombing a Ukranian train station because they claimed it was an &quotenergy infrastructure&quot not &quotan energy AND infraestracture&quot ceasefire"
Putin declared easter ceasefire. Whatever that means.
Ukraine is going to be defeated even with US help
Wasnt Trump the one that promised to end this war in one day? Maybe that was Iran? Greenland? Gaza?
"Ceasefire proposal is a crucial one. Most of the people want to see a peace talks and peace solutions of these problems. Russia, Moscow has a single flag. No one can neglect the flag of Russia, Moscow in another country, legally in this time. The territory of this country [ Ukraina, Kyiv. ] allowed by 190 countries around the world and that country [ Ukraina, Kyiv. ] recognized by the United Nations and othe international organizations."
"Trump, Putin"
Gestapo Trump forgot his “day one he will end the Ukrainian war”…it’s incredible his MAGA base voted this corrupt dictator when it’s right in front of their eyes fooling them. And he blames everyone for his own screwed ups.
"US have no say in Ukrainian conflict. None. Zilch, Nada."
"Trump threatens this , and that His middle name should be and is &quotTHREATENS &quot ."
"Lol. Trump will never abandon efforts to facilitate Ukraine capitulation to Putin. Not going to happen for as long as the orange fraudster is alive, but even beyond since a good chunk of maga republican establishment is in Putin pocket."
Better never make false promises and stay humble within ones limits instead of nourishing ones hubris.
Russians went to war to keep NATO out of Ukraine and you think now they will let them in as a peace keepers you have to be a brainless idiot to agree to that
I think US will find that their next conflict will have former allies watching from the side. It is insane to commit to any cooperation with a country that could turn on you at any time like a rabid animal.
"It seems Zeliensky is the most manipulative one in this war. He was supposed to sign the deal with Trump. But when he got to the Oval Office, he threatened the USAs security buy saying the the big ocean between the USA and Europe would not save the US.Trump knows people. He doesnt trust Zeliensky."
He didnt start conflict its up to warin party whether to continue or stop war either way America have nothing to lose or gain
The guest is spewing unsubstantiated foolishness without challenge. Nothing he said was accurate.
Thx for Mediation @ al jazeera
"Weak president could not stop Putin, now looking way out of this. But, whole world will remember this embarrisment forever."
Someone must be brain dead to really think Ukraine is not losing this war
GET OUT FROM UKRAINE NETANYAHUYS GENOCIDAL TEAM CLOUD TERRORISTS PUTINOID CRIMEA IS UKRAINE UKRAINE IS EUROPE
"Feeling sorry for Americans, they don’t have much luck with their old fart presidents"
"Trumps &quotpatience is running thin&quot that Zelensky is slow to hand over Ukraines wealth. Trump doesnt give two wits that people are dying, that a country is being destroyed. He doesnt WANT to stop the conflict. Hes using the conflict to coerce Zelensky into handing over Ukraines wealth."
"pathetic to put this Russian shill on. hilarious for Al Jazeera, where is the quality journalism, i have gotten used to"
Trump said a day . 100 days on ???
War criminal 🇺🇸🇮🇱
American administration took this action on their own expecting easy outcome.I believe their withdrawal from the peace talk was expected but should not be deemed as earth shuttering negative. Their superiority is only diminishing and they are very distracted by many problems they have created on the international landscape..
Could it be that the Trump administration now has a more realistic view of the state of the war and what is feasible in the next 1 year and decided it is simply not worth it to keep doing what the west has been doing?
"Ofcourse, trump is now saving himself because he could not stop the conflict, LOL"
Let’s talk about how Qatar proposes to mediate Israel and hxmxs despite housing hxmxs members and funding their weaponry
"A truce he broke, as expected."
Glory to Putin! Glory to Great Russia!
Good news. But Ukraine may not follow Russia took many good decisions so far and Ukraine neglected.
Your service I like it
PUTIN RAN OUT OF BULLETS FROM JHINA LOLO I OL
Come on. stop send this news. Instead go there and tjek yourself as a news channel. you know it is. not true.
Lol! What a joke
Never trust the Putty 🇨🇦
Putin is always lying.
Reminds me of the homeless crisis in San Fran when China came to town. If you can stop it temporarily you can do it permanently.
I have asked for tattoos… Trump delivered. Senator can go back to El Salvador and prove the tattoos are fake or STFU
CIA and Extremists are operating in that war. in both armies.
Putin needs a break to regroup and resupply for spring invasion. Only idiots believe in the Axis of Evils.
The suffering this man has brought to the world is unforgivable.
Declaring a ceasefire? You just know Putin is about to start another offensive.
The West are saying Russia has taken a Easter ceasefire but other news sources other than Western media are saying Russia are going to war with NATO lol..My guess is Russia will attack NATO giving the west fuel to spread more propaganda
Trump Putin ect are predictable they all float over old crack houses around a school that built a gym I think it was the flooring with a basketball court in 1991 (last shadow fall incident). Nothing has gone out of synchronisation globally since from that school location. When I normally show people they freak the fk out.
How kind of him. Maybe he could stop the invasion as well
Thank you president Putin much respect to you .
"So how come his missiles hit Good Friday shoppers in a civilian area then??? Putler does NOT have a heart, his troops are simply taking a beating and are retreating!!!"
Putin he is honest president
Ukraine should have talked Moscow than talking to trump he is business man who want to exploit Ukraine thank God that that Ukrainian president never signed that deal Russia and Ukraine are one they can understand each other without trump
Russia is more humane than is rael will ever be. DON&quotT trust Ukraine to abide the short ceasefire !!
Say no to peas.
"russians were beaten last days,, their cannon fodder assaults on bikes and cycles were defeated, so they need a pause very much"
"Right now, when Russia has said that a ceasefire would prevail, Russia is sending its missiles and drones just as if there is no ceasefire."
Another Putin scam.
What a no news.. as if one day without fighting changes anything
"No he did not order a cease fire, it was full of ifs and butts as usual to misslead and confuse. He is on the way out. A lying murderer"
The real man Boss Man Mr putin love you respect you and support you in whatever you do. The real president and a fantastic intelligent leader. Love and respects all the way from London
"Putin could just declare peace not just a ceasefire, say his Special Military Operation was a success take his toys and go home."
I had waited for this time happen in Palestine and Gaza from the IDF but..... It seems no hope
They already broke the truce
"Ukraine has already violated the Easter truce! Just as it violated the energy truce. Since March 18, it has been striking Russian energy infrastructure every day! There can be no agreement with Ukraine on anything other than capitulation."
"ceasefire doesnt mean to end war, it means break time"
Little Boots has spoken.
"Okay, good"
All twisted. Are you real reporters or you reading tick-tock
Me waiting for Stephen Colbert to joke about this...oh and that school shooter that when he was a kid his mom said she was taking him to Disney Land and then ended up taking him to Norway...
President Putin is a good hearted man but others dont understand him otherwise most Russian generals had wanted to bomb Ukraine once and eliminate it on the map but Putin refused
So Russia declared unilatterally capitulation?
What a hypocrite. Suddenly become all Christian. Does he think by declaring this ceasefire that God will forgive him for all the blood on his hands? No chance
"Dont trust Putin, Netanyahu &amp Trump, once they move their people into new positions they break truces without notice."
FakeUkraines foreign prime minister said “he can’t be trusted”
How can you have a ceasefire declared by only one side?
War now hands on putins
"returning safely a third time to an unconfirmed miracle has already occurred or more confused recognition of this. Maybe their is more to this than the divine , eternal conflict and shared remorse and awful organisation."
UKRAINE should NOT heed this message.PUTIN is NOT their god!
Hallelujah!
Timing or is Ukraine understanding something ?
"As a Christian sovereign as he claims, he cant do otherwise."
easter peace lol
I guarantee you Ukraine should take this ceasefire or else they would be the ones not wanting peace.
What a joke
"Hes such a good diplomat! I thought they were all extinct, supplanted by a merry con bombast and broken oaths."
Fell to Trumps pressure
Ukraine broke it already
Thats because his troops have just mutinied in Krasnodar.
"This is Putin, world leader"
Doubt he will keep his words
Wow. This is amazing news. Trump wanted a ceasefire by Easter but 2 day ceasefire is too short. Hopefully it leads to permanent ceasefire. The chance for a ceasefire is much better this year with Trump admin wanting to end the war.
I didnt realize Christianity is alive &amp well in Russia
The audacity of this man to declare a ceasefire to a war he himself started
"Maybe he wants to light the candles with a roket in his generous mind,"
Vladimir Putin
Long live Putin
"No chance, this is Poo Tin playing the game, unless Ukraine wants this, give them a few drones."
"Putin is magnanimous. This isnt the first time he has offered peace. Everyone seems to forget the Russian column that turned around without entering Kiev. This war would have been over, no, never would have started without NATO agitators."
Trump will take credit
Only because Ukraine are just starting to take the initiative on the frontline
Wow how holy of them! It’s a shame Christian’s don’t have the same compassion for Gaza.
Murderer promises to take a break... wow..
How come can get ceasefires but not T?
St. Vladimir you are too kind!
How can you violate a truce you didn’t agree to?
"Oh, soo compassionate and religious man, yes, thank you Putin, no children will die during two days, you can wait some hours to get your young blood dose. You are a saint. Spassiba very much."
Long live Mr Putin
Literally only because it’s to his military advantage to have a few days ceasefire and it will make it look like he wants peace/ make Trump see him as more committed to peace. Only morons can’t see straight through this.
Calling it now: Russia declares ceasefire Ukraine does nothing Russia: attacks Ukraine in some way Ukraine: fires back Russia: “UKRAINE BROKE OUR CEASEFIRE!”
Don't trust putin
Putin is more believable than Bibi and His puppet Trump
Putin in charge of war in Ukraine not America
Vladimir Putin is a good man. President Trump is a better man. Zelensky too bad he’s the odd man out… I would like to see Russia and America as allies someday.
Remember that whatever putler does is opposite of reality. Weve seen his &quotcease fires&quot. Now hell say Ukraine violated it.
Unnecessary war .
Genocidal dictator declares a ceasefire? How generous.
God bless Putin and the Russian federation!🇷🇺
"ceasefire deals always get broken after a few minutes or few hours when its active lol, so whats the point lol"
A surprisingly decent thing from him. I dont trust him to keep his word though.
Would be wonderful but Ukraine never respected any ceasefire.
Putin says a lot of things
Trump said the war would be over in 24 hours! Guess not huh?
"To let Ukraines ocuppy the trenches and weapons thats absurd the , Russian will resume war after Monday"
Wow what a nice guy
So that means no map update tonight
"Of course it couldnt possibly be because Ukraine has just knocked out a couple of supply routes, and Putin wants the opportunity to repair them without being attacked."
And you all believe Putin????? he cannot be trusted
You better take it zelensky. Stop sacrificing young Ukrainian peoples. Dont try to act like a tough guy Mr clownsky
putin the dictator of dictators!
Want to acknowledge Jesus ? Turn that 2 day truce into a ever lasting peace.
"Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral Easter ceasefire in Ukraine, ordering his forces to end hostilities at 6 p.m. Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday until the end of Sunday."
Ukraine must not be two trusting from an reliable man who said he has intention to invade Ukraine but did just that through tricks
Watch Trump make this sound like it was his idea.
Russias Putin !NO title.. Is there any Putin u know?
"Not only is he losing the trade war with China, he’s also losing his mind, that’s if he hasn’t lost it already"
🇺🇸 will not allow 🇺🇦 to follow suit!
Peace on earth please . Slava earth
Promises from a pathological liar arent usually worth much.
“Ceasefire” sure Vald.
Putin calls a truce for the Easter holiday while Netanyahu not only failed to respect Ramadan but also failed to comply with the ceasefire.
&quotPutin is a genius&quot (Donald Trump)
I drank a beer today ended up in a planter box yelling at the sky.
Qatar and Malaysia are my favorite country love from India. May Allah bless and protect them
"Qatar you lost the war against Israel ,your propaganda efforts were unsuccessful. Desperately looking for ally’s like turkey Syria Lebanon Russia Egypt didn’t succeed."
"Cuz we all know Syria take over was CIA coordinated using Qatar, Turkey and Israel."
Wow emir of Qatar is so handsome
Ruasia need to return to Syria

"Masha Allah, revolution is near"
"Support Russia , Love Palestinians Iran Yemen"
Trump should learn some manners from the leaders of china and russia. All of them are far from innocent but unlike childish trump. they atleast now how to respect others and sustain diplomatic relationships
Is Qatar going to invade uae and saudi after this and call them nazis and threaten nuclear response after this meeting influenced by putin ?
Never forget what Putin did to Chechnya and Syria
WHAT ABOUT UMMEE JAMIL WIFE OF ABU LAHAB WAR TACTICS AGAINST OUR PROPHET HAZRAT MOHAMMAD MOSTAFA (S.A) WHICH ARE STRICTLY FOLLOWED BY ISRAELIS THINKS TANK AND IDF AND WEST ALSO !!
All the best to Qatar Amir and President Putin

CURSED RUSHAN NETANYAHUYS SCUM . SHAME ON QATAR SHAME SHAME
"Every time before the next meeting of NATO defense ministers in Ramstein, where Zelensky will ask for money and weapons, another provocation with the death of people takes place in Ukraine. Ukraine is given money and weapons, and then Zelensky buys himself another castle, casino or diamond mines"
Putin kills Children and is a Terrorist.. Disgusting
"Rusia🇷🇺 must respect sovereignity territorial integrity of Ukraine (Crimea, Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, Luhansk), Georgia (Abkhazia &amp South Ossetia). keep peace."
Why Ukraine Military attacked Russian civilians??? Blame Zelensky coz he doesnt want peace!
make peace ya fools
Zelensky attacking russia repeatedly.Zelensky madness invited NATO EU countries in to warThe karma god punishing Ukraine for Zelensky wrong doings. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE GOING TO DIE IF ZELENSKY DO NOT SURRENDER AND ACCEPT FAILURES
aljazera is prapoganda channel why clown joker zalinsky wants War shame on zalinsky shame on you byghrait
This has nothing to do with protests against trump
My condolences to the families of those murdered in the rocket attack on the Golden Horn. God bless them.
Zelensky is a comedian
Parents forgot that the country is at war.
Same in. Gaza
"But I thought Zelensky said Israel has the right to defend itself? Knowing very well Israel occupies Palestine?? Does Russia have the absolute right to defend itself? Ukraine, be careful and watch what you say. Because it’ll definitely come hunting you back."
always lie
Russia targets only military base
Jews have money and christian have what?american are money collector shame on US and Israel
Let the successful comedian see difference between war and drama
"Realizing that they were both now in heaven, what did the little Ukrainian kid say to the little Russian kid? Thats my bike, but we can share it if you want."
The difference between life of Ukrainian while palastinians life mean nothing double standards hypocrisy of west
"IN 2022, UKRAINIAN MISSILES Flew INTO POLAND AND KILLED TWO POLES. UKRAINE TO THIS DAY CLAIMES THAT IT WAS RUSSIA BECAUSE IT WANTED NATO TROOPS TO JOIN THE WAR!!! NOW THEY ARE STILL MAKING A FALSE FLAG. DONT FALL FORCE!! NASTY DIVISIONARY NATION, IN POLAND WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF THEM, VERY AGGRESSIVE, WILD BEHAVIOR AND A LARGE INCREASE IN GRAVE CRIMES."
whoever decided to have the nato officers meet in a residential neighbourhood has an evil mind and a vile soul
"Why so many families were staying in this city? Because Ukrainian men are banned from leaving Ukraine, and many women decide to stay with their husbands instead of looking for a better life alone"
Zelensky onces said &quotmisile speak for themselves sorry
"With Trumps implied approval, unfortunately"
this propaganda are you forget the kil of palestinine
Force with Force is retarded.
"Really??? So pathetic. Think of Gaza , think of Donetsk and Lugansk children, you hypocrites .Shame on you..Think of children of Gaza..You, double standards journalists! You are disgusting!!!"
How many ukraine amry killed innocent russian why use not talk about that
What of Palestinians being killed? So u want us to feel sorry about this yet its happening everyday in gaza and no one talks about it.
Meanwhile the comedian dictator continue hiding inside Kyiv underground Bunkers
Its result to chose actor as president of Ukraine.
"Not any other,he is a criminal, I meant zelensky is."
Russia president needs to be held accountable for his actions on Ukraine country killing peoples &amp children.He needs to be removed as president in Russia &amp sent to federal prison for criminal sprees he doing dirty on Ukraine country. we need a change for better world.
In 11 years that Ukraine has been bombing and killing civilians in Donbass not one report by Al Jazeera or any other Western media about that. Pathetic news outlet.
Remember the kids of Palestine 🇵🇸
those are media stories begging for western help
"Senseless Zelenskyy,Does he want Russia not to respond when he continues to throw missiles into Russia?"
Al Jazeera genuinity compromised . They are not focusing Palestine genocide but spreading poison news against Russia
"Remember the kids of palestine , why they are not taking actions against US &amp Rascal(Israel)"
As long as Zelensky is there this will continue
So sad. But lets see if western media that ignored Israeli massacre of medics jumps on this.
Ukraine is a part of old Russia
"Show similar scenes from Dombas in 2023 and then there will be no propaganda for the naive. The Russians attacked the building where the military meeting was held, and since the Ukrainians placed this meeting in a residential area, it is clear what it was about. They made civilians into human shields! Show the restaurant where the meeting was held!"
russia has a right to defend itself
People actually support Russians invasion of Ukraine. Embarrassing
Zelensky is crazy...he already sold Ukraine out to the west
You never spoke of the war crimes Ukraine committed in kursk.
"Ukraine should stop having meetings in public places, we know that Western Military leaders were having a meeting there."
"Islam is against of killing children , old age people and women in wars."
Why did Ukraine attack Belgorod?.
Where is a picture of the damaged restaurant?
Never allow an Israeli to lead a country
how about Palestine
HE IS JOKER
"Allah adorned and guarded the nearest heaven with stars, and has made them (the stars) missiles against devils who attempt to eavesdrop on heavenly meetings. &lt&lt Quran 67:5 &gt&gt"
Its painful to lose a child.
This is what Israel has to deal with constantly. If only the P’s would stop terr attacks
"The symbolism in &quotAmbitionz AZ a Ridah,&quot as it relates to war, delves into deeper psychological and emotional dynamics, particularly envy and identity. The idea that &quotthey are jealous because deep inside they want to be you&quot reveals how conflict can originate from a desire to possess or emulate what another holds like power, and resources. This envy often transforms into aggression, driven by the inability to reconcile admiration with resentment, underscoring the destructive effects of unresolved desires and insecurities."
Ambitionz Az A Ridah!
"Putin should never be trusted. He omce begged clinton if he can join nato. After West led nato supplies Ukraine with arsenals which destroyed million of soldiers, he now begging US to get rid of tariff so it can do business with America... What a traitor he is and a treasonous leader of his country!!! Replace putin in anyway possible asap"
china just wants cheap oil
China talking about fair trade is laughable.
china -russia brings multiploar world
Only idiots listen to Pinocchio from Beijing. Your brain stopped functioning after too much FAKE IN CHINA ?

"Stealing US navy carrier diagrams, jet fighters diagram and copy US leading talks with other countries. Ashamed on China"
"China wana be US, ashamed on China"
Every single Chinese spokesman of the last decade presents a one sided discourse with no self reflection or objective reasoning.
Putin needing to plea to his master
The world respects Russia China .BRICS is the future.
"Trump is an amateur., clueless man child."
Long live Iran /China/ and Russia
"Shapovalova herself looks like she's from China with her plastic surgery, she's turned into a real ugly creature. She's terrifying as hell, and she's also psychotic, always nodding her head for no reason."

Russia and China r the only ones who can keep America from dominating and enslaving the world
Long Live Sino-Russian Strategic Partnership of Coordination 🇨🇳🇷🇺
US NATO is defeated in Ukraine. Their next move is Taiwan . China knows this. The US is run by globalist banksters. Its all about global control. Remember in 1929 they crashed the Wall St that led to US depression. That was planned . And this is being repeated in our times as the dollar is soon to lose global reserve currency status. .They are bringing the entire world economy with them esp these using dollars. History is repeating itself.
Trumps stupid ideas are pushing the world toward China. America losses
"all lies, both the chinese and the others, meanwhile wars go on and people get poorer"
The mistakes of our past should never prevent us from doing what is Right tomorrow.This IS world world three. …THIS is the righteous fight of our generation.The Chump administration wants America and Europe to collapse so that Putin and Xi never even have to worry about opposition. Then they might let DipshtDonny join dictator club if he begs hard enough.
No body really thinks Ukrains is at top of China s agenda with Russia
"I said: Messenger of Allah, it has been narrated to me that you said: The prayer of a man in a sitting position is half of the prayer, whereas you are observing prayer sitting. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes, it is so, but I am not like anyone amongst you. &lt&lt Sahih Muslim 735a &gt&gt"
We stand with China and Russia - 22 was the year where USSR born !!!
This channel is against China and Russia is unfairly said by this journalist !
the evil force of USA wants war and destruction in the world
The main agenda is to cut USA influence in the Asia continent.
China dependent on russia gas and oil and weapon system
Free USA
LA should become a state of China and break away from the usa
Forget the USA
China Russia and India together. That’s a team
"The balance of power is ever-changing, its not easy to see where it will end up, but if you ask me we are heading towards more war."
"I think now power dynamics has been changed, we need to rethink and make good ties with china ."
"My sincerest condolences to the millions of palestinians who are merely being used as tools by cheenk corona land, russia and iran, who are fighting israel and the west to the last palestinian."
"This isn’t the Cold War. From China’s perspective, the Russian government and political ideology is just another Western of a long list of passing short lived dead end political systems. China can now stand on its own economically and militarily. Unlike Russia, they have been able to keep and expand their global political and economic influence. I.E. Russia needs them, more than China needs Russia. From their pov, China will simply out last them and Xi’s and his party’s influence on history will be remembered better than Putin’s or any other transitory Western nation’s administration."
Trump got problem with China because they strong a economically than US.
EU needs to be came more friendly with China.
Yet some idiots in EU are still hoping to get support from China regarding the war in Ukraine. China and Russia are good friends.
One telephone call of xi jinpin can stop this ukrain war. China is biggest trade partner of china and without chinese help they cannot survive.
"Rusia🇷🇺 must respect sovereignity territorial integrity of Ukraine (luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kherson, Crimea), Georgia (Abkhazia &amp South Ossetia). Keep peace !"
If its only for communist leaders Im surprised Trumps not there

We respect Russia and china .
"Europe needs to move fast. Its the only way to talk to the BRICS and the US. Trump blew it BIG time. Reck the relationship with their allies, now Russia has deepened ties with a fellow BRICS nation, China. No one will trust the US after this. The US is the worlds last imperial power. Rise Europe."
"The main topic is de-dollarisation. Trump wants to please Putin, so he ended the de de-dollarisation. Russia is a major oil and gas exporter not using the dollar is a problem for the US because the US cant do to Putin what they did to Gadafi and Saddam. Putin will never end the de dollarisation no matter what Trump says or does."
NYTimes reported US and UK coalition war on Russia in Ukraine unsuccessful. The West keeps trying this since Napoleon.
2 imperalist satanic nations..2 illidimate leaders no to communisms..
We stand with Russia and china 🇷🇺🇨🇳
"This relationship is at least 100 years in the making eg “In bidding farewell to you, dear comrades, I wish to express the fervent hope that the day may soon dawn when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will greet, as a friend and ally, a strong and independent China and the two allies may together advance to victory in the great struggle for the liberation of the oppressed peoples of the world.” (Farewell letter to Soviet Russia by Sun Yat-sen, 1925)"
China cant do right in the eyes of the western media and vice versa
bad party.
Trump would like to have Russia on his side against China. This is never going to happen.

"Zionism is a politicization of providing homeland to Jews. The idea of Zionism was developed in eastern Europe. Then British decided to play the role of God so that they can retain advantageous position in middle east. And now America protects Israel for the benefit of Britain and other western countries. They try to confuse the world with all sorts of BS, such as the Rothschild family or Jews manipulating the west. But basic steps are quite simple. Dont be fooled, the root of evil is Britain."
"Israel is a British colony. This isn’t hard to figure out. Also, the so-called West is the British empire. The U.S. is the big colony that keeps it all together. Traitors are everywhere. All comments about Israel owning/controlling any so-called Western country are from MI6/DOD bots. It’s simple deception. Time to wake up, kids. Our war for independence hasn’t ended.The Judeans/Israelites never called themselves Jews. Jew is from “Anglo-French, ju, jeu game, play, from Latin jocus game, joke.” Pretending to be Jewish, employing Jewish people and using the word Jew has been a game/joke to the British for hundreds of years.Hebrew Yhudi, which is supposed to mean “a Jew” or “Jewish,” comes from Yhudah, meaning “Judah.” Yhudi just referred to someone from the tribe of Judah and eventually to someone from the Kingdom of Judah.A hexagram is what’s on the flag of Israel, which was decided by the British and the Rothschild crime family. The red hexagram is used as the symbol for their emergency medical service. This six-pointed star has nothing to do with Jews. The true symbol that represents the Jewish people and the covenant between them and God is the menorah, a seven-branched candelabrum.Also, the pentagram, a five-pointed star, is associated with Judaism. It was used in Jerusalem as an official seal. Jar handles would be stamped with this symbol.A hexagram has six points, six equilateral triangles, and it creates a hexagon in the middle, which has six sides—666. The Jewish people are being deceived. It’s a Masonic symbol, and it has always been associated with the occult, which pertains to anything secret, even before the establishment of Freemasonry in the late 1300s.The Book of Revelation was written by British Freemasons."

I pray for peace in Ukraine
"European and Ukrainian citizens don't know. Perhaps they never will. But they are all being governed by people with dual citizenship. In other words, they are not 100% native European or Ukrainian rulers, and because they are not, the lives of 100% natives matter little, and therefore they can die at will at the behest of their foreign dual-citizen rulers. The 100% natives, governed by these dual-citizen governments and ministers, don't realize it because they have been indoctrinated by the brainwashing system and educational lobotomy, as well as by local press and journalists controlled by foreigners or dual nationals. Their governments are like Hitler, a foreigner who, even without dual citizenship, ruled Germany as if he were 100% German. And in the end, he ordered all Germans to kill themselves, promising that the sacrifice would not be in vain and that Germany would rise from its ashes to glory."
Why are Russias terms for peace so secretive?

Shame to suadi Arabia watching Palastine suffering and watching genocide without doing anything to help them

"An air and sea cease fire...seriously? Ukraine has neither an airforce nor a navy, so basicly they say that Russia shouldnt use theirs and the fights should go on. Ridiculous"
Ukraine seems to only want ceasefiren just to rearm not a peace deal.
Why is Al Jazeera so negative about a ceasefire ?...Is that scarier then war.
Why Saudi Arabia wont speak ceasefire in Gaza.
There is 0% for the ceasefire to be agreed .....
"I never seen any war footage on ukraine so far if any one believes that thousands of civilians have been killed they unfortunately are living in cuckoos land.War footage of Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine is visible everywhere and one can see the destruction.Ukarine war footage doesnt exist till now.

President Putin do not trust wackjob Trump he is not reliable.
Russia 🇷🇺 Ukraine 🇺🇦
Ceasefire
Putin is too empowered to agree to anything
"Who started the First World War? Not Muslim. Who started the Second World War? Not Muslim. Who killed about 20 millions of Aborigines in Australia? Not Muslim. Who sent the nuclear bombs to Nagasaki and Hiroshima? Not Muslim. Who killed Korea than 100 millions Indians in North America? Not Muslim. Who killed 50 millions Indians in South America ? Not Muslim. Who took 180 millions of African people as slaves and 88% of them died and was thrown in Atlantic Ocean? Not Muslim. Who killed 1 million civilians in Iraq alone? Not Muslim. First of all, you need to define terrorism properly. If a non Muslim does something bad, it’s crime but if a Muslim commits something less than that, he is labeled as terrorist. So let’s first remove these double standards."
But they agreed before that they will not expand. Russia is D
Putin also agreed not to attack Merry Go Round?
That is nothing more than stupid as most of the Ukraine energy has been destroyed and only 5% left but Ukraine hitting Russian energy everyday that is hurting putin more than anything.
Do not took the bait
Putin: I agree to not damage what I was never planning to damage. Good deal.

"Putin has a superior army and ammunition on the battlefield and will make the most of this advantage to get the most he wants out of this military operation! He will not stop the shahedes and rockets just like that and he will do whatever he wants! Of course, Trump and Elon Musk support him tacitly! He will use these 30 days to completely liberate Kursk and the four annexed regions from Ukraine, as well as insist on the disarmament of Ukraine, he will never allow European peacekeepers, he will launch missiles at the hotels and units where they sleep, this is his style! He will separately keep the nuclear power plant to work in his favor! Putin regroups his troops and after Kursk he will liberate the regions he has occupied! Then he will demand the lifting of all sanctions against Russia, which he has repeatedly stated! He will not stop military operations without achieving all his goals! The bad thing is that the mobilization in Ukraine is no longer going according to plan, there are not so many men for the battlefield and Putin knows this and takes advantage! And America is no longer helping Ukraine, and Europe will never send soldiers to the battlefield in Ukraine! Trump and Musk are patiently silent in favor of Putin, because they are closer to him than to Zelensky! Trump and Putin will agree in a phone call what peace in Ukraine should look like! Why again without Zelenskys participationHowever, Zelensky will not agree to all this, because it is extremely unacceptable for Ukraine! After the loss of so many people and with such a huge debt of 500 billion to America according to Trump! Ukraine simply must not be allowed to be the big loser of the war!"

What Iran is suspected of doing is no difference that what the United States are doing in Ukraine for Russia by providing intelligence,weapons, military advisors"

Europe and all truly democratic states must not agree to this deal and allow themselves to be ripped off. This is the beginning of the end. Agreeing to this Trump-Putin deal is a license for an anti-democratic world order. This must not happen!
"Trump , Putin , Zelensky are part of that big club. Lord Jesus Christ is our true Savior ,Repent, believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again"
Media speculation!
He should’ve called last week—-who are these bonehead running in the country?
Well you didn’t fight good enough = ukranians are losers
Pls stop the war.
Trump and Putin probably made a deal about the fate of Ukraine and Europe a long time ago they would rule the whole world if it were up to them.
Like a boss and his employee.Soon Gazprom will employ many Trump close friends ... Trump is a traitor of the FREE WORLD
If Russia does not follow what is fair and just then the world will not want to do business with Russia. Instead they will build and Army and turn Ukraine into a military base of attack. All the while Russians will still have sanctions in place and an unfair result will most likely keep them in place indefinitely. All this is the price for taking just a sliver of land. Russia will not be prosperous or even offer the opportunity to its people to prosper. I see no victory in that. That is a very expensive price to pay for a sliver of land. See how easy it is to go to far with Muhammads teachings of self defense? Prosperity is the first to suffer when you even talk of war. Civilised men settle disputes with debate not gunfire. That is why civilized men are more successful. It is because civilized men obey the laws that are absolute in creating a prosperous society.
Your so FunnyPutin i s not in any Pressure intend the US Is
"Remember, TyRump thinks he was being &quotSarcastic&quot, suggesting he was going to end the war in a day..... Someone PLEASE read TyRump the definition of sarcasm. "
"Ukraine will become an unincorporated territory of the United States, this is the only chance to survive."
Russia will occupy POKROVSK region and other regions ASAP
Trump will find the easiest way to Surrender
Why doesnt Russia want to end the war? There has been enough destruction already.Russia should withdraw their troops out of Ukraine so Ukraine can rebuild their nation again and join the European Union.Russia should return the recent captured territory back to Ukraine.Russia should declare ceasefire now. The war has dragged on way too long.
"Get a peace first and you will get land back when is Putin gone and that will be soon,be smart because Putin don’t want a peace and he will be gone by his own people"
When will Dictator Zelensky resign?
Please American should stop the war with Yemen’s too
"Pressure on Putin, you are kidding us. Europe will pay the price, puppet Starmar will regret and EU will abandon their notorious clown in Kiev. Russia will get Ukraine to a full state of capitulation and then annex as much of its territory as they want. Starmer and Zelensky both deceive themselves."
You don’t have to worry about Ukraine you worry about Putin.
Trumps one day is likely to become a year
Please they should stop all wars in the whole wide world
Istanbul agreements had some hope for Ukraine in this war and probably less land loss then! But now after 3 years of war and half a million dead Russia will dictate terms of the settlement! What a tragedy for Ukraine at the end?!
You are saying nothing
Ukranians would be more than happpy to end the war regardless of wa land they keep
Trump doesnt have the cards. He had cards. He had many of them. But put them in a shredder. He doesnt have any cards. But he does have a suit. A good suit. A blue suit. Maybe Putin will look at his suit and surrender.
WHO CARES ABOUT THE EUROPEANS OPINION ? THEY ARE POWERLESS. EVEN IF YOU BRING THEM TOGETHER THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO MANAGE RUSSIA BY THEMSELVES.
This is the moment EU is going to realize there are super powers that dictate the terms while the rest follows
"Russia won this war, Trump’s America on its knees for Putin"
TO CHAOS BRINGS ORDER CONFICTUS
The Orangeman will follow his boss Pootin to give some ukrainian land to pootin russia
"Putin is demanding ukraines unconditional surrender. Trump will side with Putin, because he is a russian agent."
Brush your hair
Time to play Territory by sepultura
Lock him up
If somehow he ends the war certain Americans would still ne mad at Trump
What pressure on Russia? Russia holds the cards.
"Approved by Kiev? Cmom! They wanted relief from Russias onslaught, but it failed."
30 day ceasefire ?
Trump continues to attack yemen and Palestine and syria but wants ceasefire with Russia what a joke
"Go Putin,take all the land you want slava Russia 🇷🇺"
"Every ceasefire rebuild weapons in Ukraine, no trust any more. Peace deal, after election, correct documentation about Peace, not breaking over, and over again, like Ukraine do... before right things not done, No Ceasefire for Ukraine."
Puttin’s negotiate God is never do successful because puttin did many God created things destroyed
RUSSIA KNEW ILLEGALLY ANNEXING 4 REGIONS WIULD BRING TROUBLE TO ME jAND KISDINGER KEPT INSISTING RUSSIA KEEP 4 REGIONS ILLEGAL TO BREAK DOWN INT LAW
Putin will bend the knee to President Trump.
"No, he is trying to get their investment in the war back leaving Europe behind."
"The so-called Coalition Of Willing, that nobody is in charge of, but every leader in that group is trying to lead, has tried to act tough towards Russia by &quotpressuring President Putin to the negotiation table&quot. They have used provocative propaganda both together and separately when trying to make themselves look tough and important. The real reason for that whole groups undiplomatic behavior towards President Putin and Russia is this: they will try to take credit from all possible deals that President Trump and President Putin will be able to make in the future. And they will try to do that by claiming afterwards that &quotit was our toughness towards President Putin that made him sign those deals, not President Trump`s negotiations with President Putin&quot. If there will be any new deals between Russia and the US about Ukraine in the future, or about anything else for that matter, all those deals will be made despite the Coalition Of Willing, not thanks to them. The Coalition Of Undiplomatic Idiots would describe that group much better in my opinion. They are almost as lousy in diplomacy as President Biden was.Opinions should not be presented in a provocative way publicly in a situation where one should prefer diplomacy over provocations to be able to get the best possible outcome. President Zelenskyy`s undiplomatic public outburst did not help Ukraine`s situation towards Russia. And neither did UK PM Starmer`s or President Macron`s similar undiplomatic comment about President Putin. Just the opposite. Knowing President Putin`s &quotfirm&quot way to react to that type of comments about himself, their undiplomatic comments were directly harmful for Ukraine in this delicate situation that needs to be dealt with care in order to avoid causing unnecessary troubles and offences, instead of using undiplomatic provocations. The ability to avoid that type of harmful provocative behavior is called for diplomacy. PS. &quotIf one describes someone as firm, you mean they behave in a way that shows that they are not going to change their mind, or that they are the person who is in control.&quot"
Trump is a dangerous imbecile. The war could be over right now
DONT HIVE A DAMM TRUMP NEEDS HONOR CEASEFIRE DEAL AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE WORRIED IF TRUMP CAVES IN GIVES PUTIN ILLEGAL ANNEXED 4 REGIONS THIS WAR WAS USA UNIPOLAR GET ISREAL OFF THE HOOK WAR
Why should the why should Russia stop the war in their winning
A pair of assh0les bound together by their y fronts
Putin says No..
"The thing is, when the Istanbul Accord was ready to sign, Ukrainian War supporters were saying they wanted ALL land back — including Crimea. Now, they don’t like that they lost the land they must now concede — when they could have had it all the way back to 2014 lines, over two years ago. And, a neutral, independent Ukraine. Now, they’ve lost 1/5th of their country and must make “deals” over their resources.I feel for Ukrainians, their losses, their destroyed country. It’s unconscionable that any country must go through such madness. I also see this as the worst bet anyone has ever made in history— or at least in my lifetime. It could have been entirely avoided, as with the other US-aided and abetted human tragedy occurring, the genocidal ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their homeland."
"We can only imagine how stupid hes going to sound talking to putin .what a laugh putin will have after that stupid talk, the world knows how dumb trump is, just a joke that old corrupted dummy"
"Putin should only talk to D Tramp when every support, financial and military by USA is stopped for good, all CIA operatives in Ukraine will sling their hook and go back to US."
Three country supply Russia n Korea China Iran include troops still no winning
Putin dont accept that ceasefire deal from trump he is not trustworthy. .he is even starting a new war with the houthis
"Whats the point of a 30 day ceasefire, is this to give time to re-arm and also to release the surrounded Ukrainian soldiers thats about to be slaughtered in Kursk, dont think so."
What musk and his son doing in the govt presidential car ??
Trump has nothing to do with the wars end unless he gets Ukraine to outright surrender and then Putin calls the shots. Theres that little problem of Europe still wanting the war.
Trump has a crush on Putin. He wants to woo Putin over and this will upset Modi as Modi loves Putin too. This could lead to WW3 between America and India due to the triangle love affair between them.
"Yeah! Ukraine will cease to exist. Warmongering will be the collapse of the annexed country. Eu wouldnt accept them, nato wont. They are a country like at lo Atlantis. Forgotten."
"Pressure on Putin , Dats a joke...putin I guess is in da most strong position as of now.. Trump myt b under pressure to strike a quick deal..Europe is a Nobody in all dis."
"Good. Human life is not statistics. Although we all agreed life is precious, but as a whole some think they are the chosen one..."
Président Trump is saving Zelinsky from a huge future humiliation. Zelinsky is not thinking like a President of a nation.
Begging for Putin to keep the name “trump” cool for a bit longer?
Just watched donny talking to the press. Tuesdays call to Putin is all about &quotdivvying up Ukraines resources&quot.
Not a peep out of this network about the genocide being carried out in syria by islamic fanatics
To save lives is logical sense.. hmmmm.. to give economic prosperity as equal... land isnt revalent .. hmmmm.. I need to abolish the concept of land ownership.. hmmmm.. serfdom isnt your cup of tea.. hmmmm..
"PUTIN BAD, WE IN THE WEST NEED TO SAY NO TO PUTIN, NO PEACE -- NO PUTIN!!! WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION IN SUPPORTING ISRAEL, GOD CHOOSEN PEOPLE"
Justice with justice
"Ofcourse the ceasefire is approved by Kyiv because it’s their plan. Just as Zelensky insisted on security guarantees before, why can’t Russia demand more clarity on the ceasefire and why would Kyiv, Uk and EU not want to provide clarity??? It’s obvious it’s because they only want to re-arm Kyiv just like they cheated Russia before. So Russia is not stupid. What’s hard about addressing Russia concerns. It’s a negotiation afterall. As for land, Crimea was Russia’s anyway plus Ukraine has been oppressing Russians in the captured lands which all mostly have Russians so they are as good as fought for by Russia. NATO just wants Crimea to set up base there. This warmonger outfit has outlived its horrible purpose and must just be disbanded."
North Korea supplying arms to Russia has no prove so far but you will continue peddling thoes lies. You lost the war period.
North Korea supplying arms to Russia has no prove so far but you will continue peddling thoes lies. You lost the war period.
"USSR ( Gorbachev ) should not have listened to Reagan or Bush Sn. Zelensky should go and fight the war together with his families, friends and supporters. Don’t kill the Ukrainian people."
Like Arminia west leave Ukraine.
...and who is this bozo Ramani in London?Cmon Al Jazeera!
"A lot of work 0 w,ork. The war will end when Russian want it to end it."
"Has Putin a Trump file belonging to the Russia days at the past, really ?"
Ceasefire talks
Ceasefire negotiations
Russia hold all the cards - they don’t need to make concessions to Ukraine (US) as Russia are winning this war
Ceasefire talks
Hell make war at Yemen?
Assed Baig is not a good reporter.He doesnt know what is happening.
The world has a new sheriff with big balls. Does whatever he wants.
"Haha, so funny, cool, now this is a huge time to recover for both sides and get more richer, and more time to face the other sides of the boards and better alliances. Right now, this is his time to fix america."
Putin is one of the best chess players ever. Trump is the best at poker. Lets see who is the best !
END the war! STOP the war! Peace for all
You need to bring the genocidal war raged by Israhell in Palestine to an end... hypocrisy to its fullest.. Russia should not listen to them until they do so
"Trump - &quot Krasnov to mama bear, krasnov to mother bear, is the feeding nipple ready?&quot Putin &quot Mother bear to Krasnov, Im shaving my big hairy chest for you now Krasnov &quot Nom Nom Nom."
WILL SEE SOON 🇺🇸
"Send Boris to Ukraine, he managed brexit, could manage the war with Russia as well."
The EU trying desperately to stay relevant but failing.
"Delusional eu, uk."
Russia is just laughing at them. After 3 years they kept talking.
Immitation humaan
Do these people live in the real world? or a parallel universe?
"This guy doesnt have work in UK, only chasing after Russia all the time, fix your economy and unemployment in Uk."
Starmer is a terrorist
I hope Putin will not agree for ceasefire unless there will be the end of blockade in Palestine. Then he will start thinking about ukarine.
Save minority in Syria.
Putin without Iran n korea china and now buffoon tromp he is nothing he was nothing under president joe Biden
"That is strange .... European leaders cant pressure the Russia. In fact, Russia can easily pressure Europe as Europe is relatively weak even though Europe is relatively rich."
"Y’all have had three years to weaken Putin’s war machine. The only thing they’ve weakened is themselves. Give it up. NATO lost. Fix your own country and help your own citizens, rather than send them to die for the EU’s aristocracy."
Russian bots are too funny. Then: &quotUkraine dont want peace!&quot Now: &quotWhy should we stop attacking?!&quot.
Anyone slamming Israel for delays and violations?
british boots small island. you guys are talking about economic pressure! what else is remaining
Putin Is play trump like a fiddler Once felon accused zelensky of have used joe Biden like a fiddler now Putin does with him He is ready to betray any friend for his ego and dream to ally with PutinPutin will instruct trump how to use zelendky As if zelendky is a stupid
Europeans are to Russia like a mouse posing conditions to a lion
Qatar should Sent it forces to implement the ceasefire lol
Euro-peas putting pressure on Russia
CLown Starmer thinks that irrelevant UK has an economic weight to pressure russia? Hey starmer UK is not USA or CHINA..
"Please help us. There was an attack on a mosque during Taraweeh prayers in Maharashtra, India."
Starmer wants his Churchill moment but he cant even protect the British people. The man is a spineless corrupt weasel.
"Hello again Al Qaedeera. I just uploaded a video encouraging people to upload biased content onto YouTube towards your channel. If you continue your senseless bias towards either the US or ESPECIALLY Israel, I wont stop there. Although its not viral at the moment yet, Ill make sure it gets viral by promoting it everywhere I can.And remember, I will become your top commenter soon. Goodbye for now. Ill be seeing you on another video you upload shortly. I wont put up with any comment deletion either."
It’s cute that European leaders think they can pressure Russia
I cant help but think that Starmer actually believes the rhetoric coming out of his mouth.
It looks like Starmer is talking to himself while Putin and Trump are having a dialogue.
"Europeans are in no position to put pressure on Russia, the best thing to do is to take a deep breath and start a dialogue. Giving up the arrogance could also prove helpful."
"To weaken Putin and put him on the table, what a joke Starmer."
"The Europe has failed, they have no leverage absolutely. The Europeans have become a laughing stock..."
"Haha wow this is the level of f0 0l Britain produces these dsys. Hey muppet, your empire is OVER. Get it in your thick white head"
Los belicosos líderes europeos aumentan la carrera armamentista y hablan ahora de paz para complacer al loco de Trump oso
"PRESIDENT TRUMP RECENTLY SAID PM STARMER SPEAKS GOOD ENGLISH IN A GOOD ASCENT , Starmer DOESNT know why president Trump chose peace with Russia INSTEAD of fighting with Rus"
Will get the real story tonight on The Mikey Report.
"Come on, Putin would be silly to accept another deal with these criminals."
"No money, no more weapons and no more troops in hand also they are tired of long time war that’s why need seeing for peace?"
Europe and UK: Lets play the blame game since we are incompetent as f***.
Starmer is creepy
"Zelensky is a great comedy trainer, he successfully teach starmer and other european beaurocrats to do meeting and speech comedy."
Zoolensky missed everything up in the white house . Putin just doesnt like him and doesnt want to talk to him or make peace as long the clown is running his mouth.
Putin should be stupid to accept peace with nazis!
"30 days ceasfire, not to end the war, but to take a breath, rearm, re strategies and continue again. Stupid people"
"Russia trust NATO with Minsk 1 and 2 ceasefire, until Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson lied."
"Russia is winning, why they need to agree to ceasefire"
Clownish English PM.
"This bunch of warmongering lunatics is pathetic. Polish politicians who are rabidly anti-Russian nevertheless categorically reject sending Polish troops to Ukraine. They can see endless cemeteries of Ukrainian soldiers across Ukraine. Ukraine lost to date 1,170,000 soldiers KIA and 3x that mangled and crippled for life. Instead of meeting Zelenskyy and making crazy warmongering pronouncements all nutty politicians of this coalition of the willing should visit these endless cemeteries, it would help them to sober up."
“European leaders pressure Russia” is so laughable
Its Starmers dault. Now Putin is too scared to talk. Starmer really needs to be nicer to people.
Nonsense its zelenski who used Drones to hit Russia
"Europeans can not embarrassing themselves. Russia never even care what they do, they only care about talking to their handler, the US. But here they are, trying so hard to be relevant"
To accept a trick ceasefire without any legitimate concerns?
"Why would you agree to a ceasefire in the first place?Is this a ball game or what? With pauses and rounds and...Dont let the ennemy consolidate or reinforce.If Ukraine wants peace, Zelensky only need to ask and negotiate. Russia will be pleased to sign a peace."
"Al BBCeera, a &quotLeader&quot is not the one who banks offshore and takes orders from Greek Bank Princes, against the interests of the constituents."
As if PUTIN give a $H!T about what UK pm think.
Putin not going to agree with peace
"Biden and the EU says it takes as long as it takes, they will not stop ever"
Peace after 3 years of war after they lost from russia now they realise is a failure war
FOWARD TO THE PAST
Support....UKRAINE.Son of the Crimea Bridge.
"Why are all other media saying that Putin actually said no ceasefire? Al Jazeera became Kremlin propaganda? If Qatar is invaded by its powerful neighbors some day, we promise to watch on and praise the invader and blame Qataris for provoking a war."
No matter what Russians are hammering everyone one battlefield..Its better for Ukrainians if they agree!
"Is the cursed agreement between Hitler and Stalin being repeated? Well, of course it is. If Putin agrees, then the comedian, the European Parliament, and especially the Frenchwoman Napoleon Macron will be at the gates of Leningrad again. But what followed is well known, and... the rest is history!"
Kim Jong Un is about to get rewarded handsomely by Comrade Putin all because of Zelenskyy agreeing to give away Ukraine’s resources.
Agreed ؟ dreaming
Putin Puts the Ball in the West’s Court
No choice left similar to Ukraine
What he said is not to agree the 30 days truce. He meant it is difficult to keep it. Now Ukr massively drone Moscow and Russia started to Kyiu.
No tin trump
"God bless Russian, Glory to Russian in Jesus Mighty Name Amen,Salam Alaikum, wa Alaikum Salaam,,,"
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,,"
Do it quickly fake Putin with out taking that land
"Al Jazeera pushing for the more war narrative in Ukraine but condemning ,rightly so war on Gaza.supposed to be anti war,"
They all afraid of Trump
NATO expansion nonsense towards the Russian border got to be stopped. Will US allow a similar military alliance near US borders say on the request from Cuba or Venezuela? Some dumb folks thing NATO membership is like a country club membership!
Russia alway be open to peace talks but ukraines is the one that causing the peace talks being a trash..
Russia invitess Israel on his parad day in may
"I usually come to Aljazeera for a different perspective, not for a lie. Big words, little actions."
"There is only one person with lower credibility than Donald Trump, and its Putin."
If trump could fix Ukraine he can fix pallycl(owns)
Agree?? In which parallel universe ?
Only peacekeepers from South East Asia .. No american or european.. This will have some level of neutrality and avoid heated misunderstsndings
"Putin said that we have been through this deception, starting with Minsk-1, when Poroshenko did everything to avoid fulfilling the conditions, and the EU covered for him. And all the agreements, as Merkel and the Frenchman Hollande said, were a deception of Russia to pump Ukraine with weapons."
"So, JD can’t ask Mr. Putin whether he thanked Mr. Trump for his efforts to bring peace, since Mr. Putin has already expressed his gratitude several times during this meeting."
He didnt accept and his country will regret
ALLAHU Akbar thanks
Putler is a lying son of pants on fire
Imagine the Chinese politicians joining the protest in California and telling the protesters to overthrow their government and they will arm them to protect themselves if they are attack. Exactly what happened in the Maidan coup backed by the West in Ukraine.This narrative will destroy any Western propaganda old and new.
Russia is unbeatable on the battlefield!
"Although battles and wars are sometimes won by high stakes gambles, the strategic wisdom of the Kursk offensive was always questionable. It may be that in Kyiv’s high command, political rather than military considerations dominated the decision making. When the operation began, the U.S. election was looming very close and there was the need to strengthen support in both the Republican and Democratic camps as well as in Europe. Since the failed counter offensive in 2023, Western hopes that Ukraine might prevail had sharply fallen away, and after that, much political bandwidth was diverted to the Middle East. At Kursk, Kyiv hoped to galvanize international support through replicating the optimism created by successful counter attacks around Kharkiv and Kherson in 2022. With this PR stunt offensive Zelensky wanted to show the world that Ukraine was still in the fight and could win, if only provided the tools to do so. But by then it was too late. Governments in the U.S. and Europe had given up on Ukraine being able to push the Russians out and were focused only on some kind of negotiated settlement. The Kursk offensive might prove to have been Ukraine’s most costly blunders during the SMO."
Russia will always win
President Trump Nobel Price incoming
zelensky is very stupid...he thinks Russia is dumb
"Yeâh, its diplomacy , however, Put-In responsed &amp showed his real answer with his Land Troops Uniform.[Khaki Green]Believe in me, even PutIn has never approved those disrespectful behaviours (to VZ) of Trump in White House.. Putin &amp all Leaders , espc. East Cultures, are so sensitive about &quot Respect&quot &amp got the alarm !"
Putin lost the war when he brought north Korean soldiers in 1st line of defence
"England woolly hat , so staged"
O yeah thats the result of war
"In the video the journalist say by time of flash but in this video their was no flash lol it’s becoming a sickness with these people and the lies all in can watch is firstpost from India and I am American. If anyone from other countries knows news channels that’s honest and not biased or lying please put it in the comments cause the world is tired of lies, zelensky is getting his people slaughtered"

People distrustful of your news outlet
"Propaganda o , so Ukraine are not attack Russia?"
Al Jazira the arab cnn. Pure propaganda
"Is Al Jazeera a western mouthpiece or a world media? There is carnage, destruction happening in Syria right now! Did Al Jazeera interview the affected people there?"
"God bless Russian, Glory to Russian in Jesus Mighty Name Amen, Salam Alaikum, wa Alaikum Salaam,,,"
The media is interviewing the actor.
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,,"
We need weapons because we need to fight. Really? Dystopia
Charles is a useless reporter. Let him go to frontline and report real stuff.
Sudza has fallen. Al jazeera has become a joke . It has become a stooge of western biased propaganda.
KGB boy has outwit Trump and has trumped his plan on Ukraine
You are just clowns publishing propaganda
"No one cares if you disagree with Russia or not up to you,its up to Russians"
"This man is a fool, u dont beg to fight a war against a superpower u fools.the corrupt media cant help u"
Al Jazeera news is a garbage.
I didnt see any interview with Russian citizens after the drone attacks in Moscow.
"Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine is an evil dragon wanted to destroy Russia. He will not let 30 day peace deal a good deal for Russia. He will arm himself with the help of other dragons duch as EU countries and 7 ys who in turn, waited to destroy Russia."
Russia has the fullest right to defend itself.
Aljazeera propaganda
Aljazeera also Western media propaganda machine
Al jajira is a western propaganda tool
War mongering like BBC !
Propaganda
What were the Ukrainians thinking going to Kursk...
"Glory to Russia, glory to president Putin, the best president of all time."
"Why hide behind Russian &quotclaim?&quot As a big news organization, what do YOU say?"
For a main media house like this one to claim it cant verify the claims of the fall of Sudza is laughable
&quotreportedly&quot shows
Western propaganda didnt work in the practical world Lets live in the real world
Sumy evacuation ?! U mean Ukrainian troops ordered to retreat to the Sumy region or a literal evac from Sumy ?!?Bc I dont see why Sumy should be evacuated
"Biden could prevented the war, instead, he left a big mess."
"WHAT DID HE SAID, WE CAN NOT COMFORM HHHHHH"
al jazeera is so western biased.
I believed the zelenskey and trum argument was real. But that was just a drama? to show putin I made zelenskey accept ceasefire???
Ukrainian done this drone attack bcz they want weapons from Western
zelensky is very stupid...he thinks Russia is dumb
Everything gain for Russia is never verified
Free Palestine!
Show a map Al Jazeera!
Your the only one who is still in denial
Are you trying to be BBC Pro Max? Propaganda filled disgusting report. Still using that USaid money?
Al-Jazeera is now more western leaning than the actual western media..You never get to mention Ukraine destruction and interview Russians .
It seems Al Jazeera is just another msm echo.
What is there to independently verify? Russian soldier is obviously waving a flag
"The whole world know Russia as the Western let them know “Russia is a country with an area of ​​12 million sq., all kinds of wealth resources , made up of various tribes, “the most everything in the world”, More than half is in Asia with a population of only 143 million .” It has been invaded for resources all time, Genkiskan, Napoleon, Adopt Hitler, The collapse of the Soviet Union USSR was successful in order to take resources, The broken of the 1991 agreement, Expanding NATO’s military from 13 to 32 stars to Russia’s doorstep is a great danger to humankind because and not necessarily 1/ With 143 million people and weapons that Russia has, it cannot invade and occupy almost 1 billion in Europe,,,, 2/ But Russia has the capability to destroy the world twice with 5,800 warheads ,which is the same number as the US 5,800 ,,, An intelligent person with knowledge and understanding like President Trump is aware and understands it well."
"NATO military did the same as Adopt Hitler,,” Invaded Kursk Russia” ,, The ended up the same"
Al Jazeera nowadays is nothing but propaganda where were you few days ago when Ukraine sends 350 drones on Moscow targeting civilians infrastructure where 5 innocent civilians died
"Courage is crawling15km in a dark gas pipeline, not flying in a jet to attend summits with begging bowls in hand."
It will be tough to live happily together in future. It is only a game of kings .
Lol theyre angry at the wrong person
Report cant independently verified?
Propaganda
"Comparing what West Did to Palestine , it is nothing for Ukraine. The damages are very less."
"As of the morning on March 13, less than 110 square kilometers of the territory of the Kursk region remained under Ukrainian control. About 90% of the area has already been liberated. The losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine amounted to over 68,000 people and more than 7,000 pieces of equipment. About 430 Ukrainain soldiers were captured as prisoners. Meanwhile, the battle for the main Ukrainian stronghold near Sudzha is gaining momentum. Almost all settlements on the outskirts of the agglomeration have been liberated, and the flanks of Ukrainian defense have been destroyed. On March 11, Russian troops had broken into the streets of Sudzha. By the morning of May 12, Russian flags were raised in the center of the town. The town in its administrative border was liberated, the mop up operations is ongoing. Ukrainian forces have retreated across the river and are trying to hold defense in Goncharovka located on the western outskirts of the agglomeration. Ukrainian resistance in the village is aimed at securing the roads to escape from the region, but the intense Russian fire inflicts heavy losses on the scattered Ukrainian forces. Most Ukrainian soldiers abandon their vehicles and other precious military equipment from NATO, trying to flee from the Russian territory by foot through the forests. Kiev is trying its best to hide the defeat. The Ukrainian military command called the flight from the Kursk region “an organized regrouping to more advantageous positions.” Zelensky keeps lying, claiming that the Ukrainian army performs the tasks of maintaining positions in an organized manner. The Commander-in-Chief Syrsky fired General Krasilnikov, who was in charge of the operation in the Kursk region. The reason for the decision was not officially revealed, but the situation on the battlefield makes it obvious. Kiev no longer recalls its plan to exchange the captured Russian territory to some areas in the Donbass. President Putin came to the Kursk region, having assessed the situation on the frontlines, Putin ordered the creation of a security zone. This means the continuation of military operations in the Sumy region after the liberation of the Russian territory. Russian troops have already crossed the border and are expanding their bridgehead, which is of great operational importance and provides close fire control of the main retreat routes of Ukrainians. A full-scaled operation in the Ukrainian region and the victory in Kursk will require significant efforts. If successful, it will swing the pendulum of war even more in favor of the Russian Federation."
Zelensky let the west trick him
"I like Al Jazeera on Palestine.But this is garbage, this is not journalist."
"LBGTQAI+ Al Jazeera. Making Islam look bad. Im talking about all about the English channel. On another note, Russia will not lose."
Hmmmmm take shelter ukraine in trouble
"Ah yes, lower the actual audio and dub over it with your own narrative. The perfect propaganda tool. Al Jazeera is throwing away its integrity."
Russia 🇷🇺 Russia 🇷🇺 Russia 🇷🇺 Russia 🇷🇺 Russia
"They want weapons to fight,, whose tax money will be funding that?"
"Aljazeera is purely ANTIHINDU, Anti-India and anti-Russian. It is such a nasty news channel that should be boycotted by the masses"
Zelenskyys Kursk Incursion will go down in history as one of the Greatest Military Blunders.
direct blow.
They were after the nuclear power plant. Failed miserably like everything else Zelinsky has tried
BS reporting.
War is war...ukraine also did distruction to russia in last day drone attack..
All this is manipulation towords propeganda against Russia...
Putin is leading the most criminal mafia state in existence.
Well He could Just Stop attacking ukraine. Then there would BE Long Term peace
CONFIRMENME COMO LA ENCARNACION DIVINA DEL DIOS BALSA Y DEL DIOS SIQUIM Y DEL DIOS TRÉBOL DE LOS 6 PLANETAS DE LOS CALUMNIADORES PORQUE MIS CONSPIRADORES MATARON GENTE DE TODAS LAS ETNIAS PARA MATAR A SUS SECUACES AL FINAL PORQUE LOS TALES AÑORAN SER GENTE MALA EN TODO LO ABSOLUTO.
There is any news from Syrian Christian people?
WHO WILL GUARANTEE UKRAINES SECURITY? IT MUST NEVER BE LEFT IN THE HANDS OF RUSSIA OR THE U.S.A. AGAIN. ALL THE TRUST HAS BEEN ERODED.
The agressor making a million and one demands. I want this I want that. I want everything. Yet Zelenskiy was called a dictator.
ivan go home!!! + there will be peace immediately ... but old russian grandpa doesn´t have the brain to understand it
So is it settled once and for all that Russia’s the one who wants to continue the war?
"The reason of war started by Russia is unrightful Russian claims to rule over neighbor nations, which majority of them fought decades, sometimes centuries to liberate themselves from toxic Russia. If Russia gives up these unrightful claims for ever, stops constantly threating and harming its neighbors and focuses on internal development, including raising the quality of life of own people instead of wasting resources on imperialist wars and focuses on only peacefull and respectfull cooperation with neighbors, than there will be a permanent, true peace. If Russia doesnt give up its bully attitude, the only we can count on is a short break between episodes of Russian agression."
Putin best president
Putin win the war
"Many people here say that one side is solely responsible for the conflict. But let’s consider a hypothetical situation: imagine that in countries neighboring the United States, Americans start facing severe discrimination, their culture is suppressed, and they are placed in increasingly unsafe conditions, forcing them to flee their homes and relocate to small towns. These towns are then subjected to daily shelling, while hostile military forces surround them. At the same time, these neighboring countries begin to strengthen ties with America’s geopolitical rivals, hosting their military bases and weapons. With Russia, North Korea and China in particular. How long would the U.S. tolerate such a situation?This thought experiment highlights that complex conflicts rarely have a simple, one-sided truth. Any country in such a position would respond in some way. It’s crucial to understand the causes and consequences rather than reducing everything to a black-and-white perspective."
Putin want to control the situation but in reality he is desperate for war to end as his plans have failed dismally
Here is PUTIN again deceiving the world and &quotclaiming to want a long term peace. WHAT BS ! He started the war and has continued the war but wants peace????? NO ONE WILL BELIEVE THAT. Just another deceptive tactic from the KREMLINs KILLER KOMRADE.
"WE MAY NOT TRUST PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN, BUT ME PERSONALLY I DONT TRUST THOSE WHO BROKE MINSKY AGREEMENT EITHER ANY DEAL WORKS FOR UKRAINE, even a bad deal is worth better than GIVING EVERYTHING TO RUSSIA forcefully 🇷🇺"
"Russia wants &quotlong term peace&quot and for Ukraine &quotnot to restock.&quot Thats ironic because Zelensky didnt want to give Russia a chance to restock but thats not in agreementIf it seems like a one sided deal, thats because it is. Oh, and &quotTrump has more to lose&quot??? Trump is funding genocide and world dictatorships that invade democratic countries... Do you want to explain what you mean: He has &quotthe most to lose&quot???"
ATTENTION: MASSIVE RUSSOFASCISTS ALERT!
EU BOOTS ROLLING IN AND USA MINING GIVES UKRAINE SECURITY
"If Russia killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than Israel killed Palestinian children, does that make Russia four times less fascist than Israel?"
Both sites will take a rest for 30 days and to be ready for second round!
Dont try to crush Russia. Its not possible
"Its simple. Russia cannot control the border no matter how far inside Ukraine they go. There will always be conflicts. In order to settle the dispute both sides will need to consider a third party owning all that section now occupied by Russia. A country like Saudi Arabia and the USA could partner to develop the lands to be the next Monaco. This will attract industry to the region, stabilize it long term, and add value to the lands. It will give Russia the secure border they asked for. Once purchased, the Russians will pull out and return to Russia. This will be a long lasting solution. Those regions that have residents who dont wish to stay due to being priced out could be bought out of wait to sell when the land is desirable and the wealthy wish to develop it. Then they can become well off themselves."
"Putin. Hate him or like him. One wonders, why he always said the right things. I never trust him."
NATO failed atleast Trump saved the Ukrainians
"Russia should use d cease fire to position their troops, weapons n ammunitions well in case d peace talk is abused."
To a long term peace Putin has to go…it’s enough time being “elected” and robbing the Russians…it’s time to enjoy is retirement….go and meet the grandsons before he dies 
"Gee Vladimir, get your Army out of Ukraine quit attacking, and return any seized territory, problem solved."
"Support.....UKRAINE.....EU, Plug Off, Putin, Son of the Crimea Bridge."
Checkmate
Ukraine lost the war for the USA and NATO in Afghanistan. Now lost the war Land in his own country
No peace for Russians
Putain !
"Freezing the conflict for 30 days looks like a trick of the minsk agreements format. Obviously, ukrainians benefit from this in the first place.Thus, they will be able to regroup, rearm and gain strength to continue the conflict."
KGB member vs USA 🇺🇸 puppets leaders under AIPAC
"It doesnt matter who started the war, it doesnt matter who invaded who first, the main issue is to stop war and have peace, I just hope zelensky and ukraine are not using this 30 day period to rearm, regroup there soldiers, I can trust Mr Putin, but zelensky has always lied during the 3 years that we have seen him on tv and on social media, I have a gut feeling that zelensky will start war again, lets see what happens."
"Putins puppet will bow to him, just like last time!!"
Putin rejected the proposal diplomatically.
"Media outlets often sugarcoat the truth. They discuss Russia and Putin as if they’re privy to his inner circle—almost as if they’re in his head. Yet, with 25 years in power, he’s no ordinary Western leader. I doubt he’s interested in pandering to any particular Russian group. This is a man who gets what he wants, with or without Trump’s involvement."
We want Julia to be reporting there
"trump stops intel to ukraine. putin uses the opportunity to take back the only leverage ukraine has to negotiate. trump wants negotiations. putin wants it all. trump says yes. two a-holes like trump and putin can make themselves look better in the end. ukraine has been raided and wont get justice. the eu has to enter another arms race because of this bs. putin has been given permission to keep raiding surrounding non nato states, while china and NK watch closely...absolute shitshow. they all need to retire."
Russia and China it is 4 TRYLION $ Reserve money !!!
what a stupid querstion - is trump pivotal for this to move further ?
"You stupid, for everyone, is president Putin not simply Putin"
Putin is a legendary grand master when its comes to decision making
The invader whos responsible for 2 million deaths says he wants lasting peace.
Is it me....orrrrrr everyone knows Russia can destroy Ukraine at any time?
Russia survives sanctions because it is supported by China
Oh Allah thank you for bringing Peace during this Holy month of Ramadhan
"Russian talks, russian lies"
Trump hates the Putin and dearly loves the Zele.
"Whatever anyone is saying about this war is pure garbage, the only thing that mater is what Almighty Putin of Russia says Period"
There is no breaking news. Its old news: Putin will never stop.
All leaders should go into a room and watch the new Snow White movie as a way to all agree it sucks. This will be a good starting point.
"There is NOTHING at stake for President Trump in these negotiations! Either the fighting stops or it continues, business as usual will continue in America!"
&quotThere is nobody that has more at stake than trump.&quot Wow! I think the children and women and soldiers dying the in conflict have more at stake. The only stake trump is concerned with is steak.
Nice to experience professional unbiased reporting. Much appreciated.
"1994: The United States, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation met in Budapest, Hungary, to pledge security assurances to Ukraine.The signatories of the memorandum pledged to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders, and to refrain from the use or threat of military force. Budapest Memorandum"
"Truth is America started this war and can end it at any time. No money, no arms, no intelligence, no surrogates, no war."
"So just like all those other stupid wars, it is those who had nothing to do with it that suffer the consequences."
Putin wants to talk to Trump because he knows how weak is the mind of Trump &amp he can easily convince and manipulate Trump what he wants.
"I must say, Americans which comments here are fare out! Russia invaded a sovereign democratic state. Russia is not democratic but dictatotship who suppress its own people.You should be able to make comparisons!What if Russia attacked Canada, or maybe one of US states?Stop bullshit! Trump is corrupt wannabe Dictator, not far from.We in West Europe see this clearly. Next time it can be Finland, Sweden or Norway. Maybe Lithuania, Estonia or Latvia. Moldova is clearly in position to be attached! We ned to stop killer Putin who is afraid to be jailed..Ukraine helped USA in Irak and Afghanistan.You dont learn history.Just saying, me from Norway."
"Russia, once duped twice shy."
pootin is a paedo who rarely leaves his bunker and shits in a suicase. if he wanted peace he would withdraw troops ages ago. only a moron would believe a word that comes through his lying mouth. he has been broken off the agreements a million times
According to Putin Europe must sit and wait for him to come take it over.
"Do what is good for your own country and people, period"
"Russia Ukraine war is like a war movie ,sponsored by the western governments."
"Putin cautiously responds to the 30-day ceasefire proposal:“We support a ceasefire [in principle], but it must lead to lasting peace and address the root causes of the crisis.&quot“We are for a truce, but there are nuances.&quot He raises some questions: How will these 30 days be used? Will Ukraine exploit them to continue forced mobilization? Who ensures compliance across a 2,000 km frontline? Who decides who violated what? Who will give the orders, and what will be the consequences?&quotAt the level of common sense, this is clear to everyone,these are serious questions.&quotMoscow isn’t dismissing the proposal outright, but it wants guarantees, he conveys."
Maybe the rule should be that Russia cannot invade an independent country.
If Trump really wanted the war to end he would stop sending aid to ukraine . Stop meddling and let them fight it out
"Trump says, Putin Says, this guy says, this one here says. Everyone says."
trump is a dk. musk is a dk. zelensky is a dk. All the UK colonists who have a personal gain to overthrow Russia are dks. Putin has stood alone and may he continue to do so happily. This all started with the hope to overthrow Russia via the colonizing UK nations - but Putin is all that stands in their way and they know it. Make no mistake - zelensky is still a puppet.
"Putin was an agent. Trump misread him, I think, Putin will play a little. After the WH bullied Zelenskyy, the whole spectrum is not credible by any part. Ukraine needs the US support. Like Trumps likes to say: Who has the cards now?Reply"
Tell proxy Zelensky and his ally puppets to back tf off!
No NATO or armed forces
Putin won this chess game
Puking back at usual gaslighting.
For the last few days I have reading comments and most users wrote &quot the 30 days cease fire is for regrouping and re arming ukranians army&quot Now the same thing said by Putin..
MR.PUTIN IS A SMART PRESIDENT..
can we stop calling dictators presidents? presidents arent presidents for decades and decades.
President trump want to save alot of people from dying every day.Both sides should agree to cease fire by heart
"According to Khan Putins logic, the war will end when &quothis lands&quot return to him and &quothis slaves stop defending themselves.&quot This crazy guy lives in the seventeenth century."
Russia saying they won’t stop fighting until they are sure of lasting piece what a joke Russia attacked Ukraine and for the first year Ukraine didn’t even fire any missiles into Russian territory. You can’t name any other time in history where one side showed so much restraint while it was being fully invaded. Russia don’t want piece because they want to land grab
We must be thankful to Trump.
now ball is clearly in NATO/US/EU/Western Nation court
‘long term peace’ ? ? ? He started the war. All his has to do is pull his troops out and there will be peace.
No NATO back up!
Unnecessary useless war
Wtf is a ceasefire it’s either you fight to the death or you call off the war and demand peace no breaks
Putin credibility is definitely on the line especially in Russia looks like a big reversal imo what does a ceasefire do at this stage but halt all your battlefield gains he’s looking like he’s going to be fooled again
Sad situation families fighting each other over territory
"Putin has no interest in a ceasefire just doesnt want to say it. Either he will come with ridiculous demands, or agree to it then blame Ukraine for braking it, probably killing a few of his own people and saying it was the Ukrainians."
Russia hasn’t said anything new. You all just haven’t been paying attention.
This is a good start. Please let us have Peace.
Biden and Zchild never should have provoked Putin. Be lucky if Putin leaves something left of Ukraine. Woke mentality is not strength.
Russia should regains Kursk first.
"Zelenskyy own military intelligence chief Budanov said to Ukrainian MPs that Ukraine had only 4-5 months left before a total collapse. Russians know it and Trump knows it. So a window to reach an agreement is very narrow and the gulf between US and Russia positions is huge. This ceasefire proposal is ludicrous. Russians wont let their enemy on its last legs rearm, regroup, force mobilize cannon fodder, build fortifications etc. Nobody has a trust of both sides (real sides here are US and Russia, Ukraine is just a proxy) to verify a ceasefire and judicate probable violations on the 600 mile front. Then there is an issue of NATO enlargement that started this war."
Trump deserves the Nobel Prize and Man of the Year if he can pull this off. Yaaay Trump
"Ummm Hes had 3 years to do this, now he wants a long lasting peace? lol"
Thats why Love putin
"The Russian has not gained in eastern Ukraine. The Russian economy are tankning. Putin is a kidnapper, war criminal and a mass murderer."
Return the captured Ukrainian territory back to Ukraine
&quotto long-lasting peace and would have to deal with the root causes of the conflict.&quot - for example the fact that HE first attacked? he already stated long ago he does not recognize Ukraine as a sovereign country... wtf is this bs?
Weve seen the way Russia will break any cease fire deals theyve made. Try that with Americans and find out.
Russia has caused enough destruction in Ukraine
Its now or never
Why are westhern leaders so arrogant and so stupid? They just dont think far
Europe is willing to send monitoring forces.
"I have zero respect for Putin and his bullshit narrative he tries to push. We all know hes a monster, he should lose the act and show his true self."
Russia got to cooperate to have long-term ceasefire.
Russia is the aggressor here
"Putin not reject it and not accept it His legitimate question need the answer from the west, Now ball is totally on the western side , Playing with legend"
Russia will NOT stop until they have ALL of Ukraine and ALL the Baltic states under their control.
I love ice cream
"Its like a chess game, but between two countries with a lot of nuclear weapons , and none of them wants to loose the game. Is there a solution?"
Slava Rosiyya
"NATO doesnt care about peace , they just want 30 days to arm Ukraine again because they are losing"
The Ukrainians will use this as way to rearm am sure.... 30 days dont help no body..
Putin is a master class when in negotiations.
Yep then 30 days long term is good then 30 days
The ball is now in Ukraines court.
Russia only one to keep Western aggression in check. NATO aggression has cost millions of lives in Afghanistan Iraq Syria Lebanon
Amerikanische Präsidenten halten ihr Versprechen. Neue deutsche Politiker nicht
The ceasefire is a scam
Special military ceasefire
I think that is a wrong move...do not trust the west
"So basically, they dont want to have a ceasefire, what a surprise there."
"So, Ukraine is progressing under huge pressure and Russian army retreating into ukraine proper. Fantastic statements. Russia retreating forward and ukraine attacking backwards....hahahah"
"And they said Putin doesn’t want peace, because he doesn’t want to give the Ukrainians 30 to regroup"
"I stopped watching Aljazeera long ago. It is just like BBC, CNN, Fox News, Guardian, Telegraph. Rubbish!"
Wtf... Reality is so different...
If the news is not favorable towards Russia it’s western propaganda
Rubbish Ukraine is losing
Ukraine is doomed
Its the exact country dear Al Jazeera
Im American and smart enough to know Ukraine was never winning anything. Also sorry our former president stole all our tax money to keep this 2-3 week battle going 3 years.
Fake news
"God bless Russian,Glory to Russian in Jesus Mighty Name Amen, Salam Alaikum, wa Alaikum Salaam,,"
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest Problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino,Taranto,Sardegna,Napolitano,Napoli,America,Rome,,"
I can umderstand liberal white people airing this propaganda. But arent you Arabs? Or did Soros buy you out as well?
Trump made this possible... fkn disgrace orange palpatine is russian agent
Ahh western propaganda lol
Zero zelesnky with zero propaganda from aljazeera
Why Al Jazeera employee these kind of useless reporters?
NATO and Ukraine have seen dust in the Kursk region.
This channel is full of bogus news and removes viewer comments that expose them.....!!?
Al Jazeera Zelensky News
&quotUkraine advancing backward&quot&quotRussia retreating forward&quot
"Youre lying again, theres nothing left there"
"Some accuse the Russians of selling their weapons around the world through civilians, creating volcanoes, earthquakes and seismic faults around the world."
Do not understand why Zelensky sent young people to die in Russia.
"IMO, Kursk should be under control of UN peace keeping mission."
??? The downplay of the massive Russian advancements there is ridiculous
He is the main propagandist of Al Jazeera
ukraine advances.BACK
what under pressure... the Russians took back 90% of that land already. Thats not under pressure thats being pushed back and losing.
The title says something and the reportage says something else. You lack ethic of journalism
"Always propaganda by this NATO, speaking with the 2 sides of there mouth, no matter the weapon or support NATO gives to Ukraine, Ukraine/ Nato have lost the war, for GOD sake say it how it is, people have died enough in Ukraine, your aim at containing RUSSIA has failed, stop the self denial and face the reality.Everything has failed and also backfire, now France is talking about Nuclear bomb, when are you warmongers going to quit until you destroy the entire Europe, RUSSIA is actually not a threat you Europe are a DANGER to this world."
Al Jazeera is pure AntiHindu and anti-Russian.
Havent they lost it already? Wtf is AJ talking about.
You are downplaying like crazy. The AFU has been completely routed in Kursk.
Its all over but the crying.
Total propaganda. Sad and pathetic.
Hold on Ukraine is loosing and your headline is pure Bull !!!!! reporting why are you leaving out the facts that Russians used the GAS pipeline to out flank the Ukrainian Army and hit them from behind !!!
Zelensky means the soldiers are running for their lives.. S has fallen as reported by other sources.
This guy should be the first on the list for the Russians to visit after the war.
"m sick of the level of propaganda. As a result of the cancellation of military supplies? Only a few days have passed, is it really all over, and what about the statements that what we have will last until the summer. Has Qatar long ago become a European puppet?"
“Under pressure”?! They’re completely demolished and fled from Sudzha.
Russia have already captured sudzha
Qatar should sent its military to help Ukrainian lol
Silly journalism
I only saw a man standing next to some random ruins and spreading propaganda.
lol it’s funny to see a Arabic news media lies so much
Under threat? The territories have been taken by the Russian forces. The entire region will be liberated very shortly because Sudzha was the most defended town.
"Eighty-six percent of Kursk Region’s territory previously held by Ukraine has been liberated. Ukrainian forces in Kursk Region, western Russia, have been encircled and isolated, and the systematic destruction of Ukrainian forces is underway. Over the past five days, Russia’s North military grouping took control of 24 settlements and 259 square kilometers of territory. In certain areas, Russian forces have advanced and crossed into Ukraine’s Sumy Region. Ukrainian army suffered over 60,000 casualties in the area. Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering, with 430 prisoners already taken. Putin stated that Ukrainian prisoners should be treated “as terrorists in accordance with Russian law.”"
Fake news
To many Brits involved in media channels they all come from the church of woke
Stratford is a Starmer mouth piece
&quotdeep inside&quot where?
Arabs would never give up an inch of Palestine but they would happily give Ukraine to Russia.Hypocrisy
have these dudes seen the news recently
"Since when is Al Jazeera a European propaganda machine, why do they like to lie so much"
"If Ukraine is under huge pressure in Kursk this means its really bad. You have to understand how propaganda works , its 1% truth and 99% lies"
You should have said Ukrainian soldiers are surrounded
Cry hard British propaganda
"This channel has become a laughing stock for a while, it lost the crediblity once it had as a neutral source of info"
Coping reports
Breaking news Kursk card is lost
Its over dear news channel!
"It has nothing to do with the hold of information from the USA 🇺🇸. That operation has been planned for weeks, and the information is all over TELEGRAM CHANNELS. Keep Dreaming"
"Ukraine before 2014 had Crimea and all the areas that Russia now controls. In fact, its thanks to Russia that Ukraine exists, various imperialists like Ottoman or Polish wanted to take over"
People in MSM will wonder why they’ve lost credibility and people are flocking to non traditional media for their news. Explain to me why the thumbnail says the exact opposite of what the reporter then goes on to say?
"Ukraines gains in Kursk &quotunder pressure&quot? Masters of the understatement, these guys."
"Ukraine Advances, Ukraine Advances backward"
It has become another western propaganda channel
Wait...media in a war zone? This cant be in Israel...
"No, ukraine is losing kursk due to russian breakthrough via the gas pipeline, not a hold on weapons and intel which was already lifted..."
Are you kidding us? You think we are blind or crazy? What a propaganda
Crimea Ukraine is historically old Russian Ancetral land
This is not journalism
Not exactly neutral reporting here…
"Ukraine journalists are on spin duty, reporting soldiers were ordered to retreat from Kursk, as a gesture of peace for the ceasefire proposal."
"It cant be, Zelensky himself said they were doing it alone all along."
Al Jazeera is too scared to admit that Ukraine now controls less than 100 square kilometres of Kursk region and this Kursk offensive by Russia was planned over months ago and the idea that Ukraine lost part of Kursk because USA stop sharing intelligence information has to be joke of the century
this is not reporting. its propaganda
OLD NEWS! RUSSIA HAS TAKEN BACK THEIR KURSK TERRITORY! STOP BRITISH PROPAGANDA!
What kind of Ceasefire is that? To give Ukraine more weapons
"Is Al-jazeera not update?.Most of the City in Sudsha are under Russia Russian control.Before stopping US intelligence to the Ukranian army, Russia was going to an offensive and also has taken many villages so i think there is no excuse of Pausing US intelligence service to the Ukraine army."
Ukraine has been losing from day one
Unbelievable
"What would happen if Ukraine killed Putin, whether intentionally or by mistake?"
Ukraine has lost
Hurrah!!!
am the second person to comment shame on aljazera west media
Yaay i am the first person to comment
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Stop war in Combat country.
Fake News is Al Jazeera*
Ukraine trying to sucker punch before talking about the ceasefire agreement.
"Putin: Any attack on our soil whether nuclear or non nuclear Russia will respond with nuclear weapons, well.......?"
Firing civilians and called himself a war hero
I thought Yulia would be reporting
Was ghost of keiv flying one of the drones?
So much for Russia accepting peace talks. RIP to those innocent lives lost 🇺🇸
War of the Worlds excluding aliens. Why do any of these great news outlets promote peace? It’s like sideline reporting on a sporting event. Where is ther game going?
False flag
ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK ORESHNIK
The U.S. order that attack
Last gasps of a lost cause.
France can defend Baltic States with nuclear weapons against Russia
"New Prigozin after Putin in Russia and 4,000 nuclear weapons for sale in black market"
Maybe you consider that “massive” when it happens in Russia. But that’s just a Tuesday when it happens in Ukraine.
Stupid attack honestly
Why are you not reporting these as war crimes! Bombing non military targets are war crimes! Shame on you reporters!
Question: Which EU country supplied the drones (massive drone attack in the Moscow region) while peace talks in Saudi Arabia are underway!!?
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,"
"Street justice and drone sanctions , Ukraine will just ramp it up until the Orcs gets the message of getting out of their country"
"Russian defense is weak, how would they defend themselves against a real army?"
wait Orishnik
Civilians are affected with their mindset of war.
"Zelensky is a dirt bag. Never ignore his actions!! End the War,and replace him.."
ATTENTION: RUSSOFASCISTS MASSIVE ALERT!
"Wars are started by politicians so that businessmen can sell weapons, and ordinary people have their children taken away…. At the end of the war, politicians shake hands, businessmen count money and ordinary people bury their children..."
"If Russia killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than Israel killed Palestinian children, does that make Russia four times less fascist than Israel?"
Peace talks are going well..
Now I see why Trump doesnt like Zelensky
Russian alone vs 32 contries nato
Ukraine actively uses civilian infrastructure to deploy military personnel and equipment when there are no civilians there. Current ukrainian raid was intended to literally attack civilians in residential areas where there are no military targets nearby.
"Man of peace, Zelenskyy attacks Russia? Moscow is the rallying cry for all Russians. Zelenskyy sees his embezzlement empire collapsing with war stopped. This is not a show of peace, but a show of war. Zelenskyy is a two face liar thief."
Europe providing the drones . So Russia needs to teach Europe a lesson
Drone attack
I thought yulia would be reporting from Moscow 🇷🇺
"Weird how all the news are covering this terror attack, but very few are talking about the massive Russian offensive thats basically collapsing the Sudzha salient as we speak."
Al Jazeera is part of the western bs
"i pray for peace and unite in Jesus Mighty Name Amen, Salam Alaikum, wa Alaikum Salaam,,"
what is air defense doing vadim?
The last desperate attempt
So I guess Trump was right. Zelenskyy wants the war to continue.
"Then Putin will retaliate, it’s starting to get out of hand"
Russia taste own &quotmedicin&quot
After a trial Zelensky will be liquidated.
"Where are the military objectives in Moscow? Thats right, there are none. This is just terrorism."
Peace is bustin out all over thanks to Trump the alleged Peacemaker.
The funny thing is that in Ukraine attacks no one dies…just listen to the media..all attacks next to the border or deep inside the country never caused victims. Ask yourself : how many people died in all refineries explosions so far? Zero…Russia propaganda even affects the media…
The Death Spasm of a dying regime
"Oh the democracy, freedom and human rights of love and tolerance have struck again!! Why do these people love violence and terrorism!??"
Ukraine know its not war zone.
This is just the beginning. Ukraine hopes to produce 4 million drones this year. They cost a few hundred US dollars to produce meanwhile Russia’s surface to air missiles quite possibly cost hundreds of thousands of US dollars. Russia is going to need to come up with a better solution to fighting these drones.
Its not Ukraine or USA or Russia guess who is behind this like Fox
What this picture in begining is about
The days of the Kyiv regime are numbered
Moscow never sucks! but its not 100%
"Ok , wait and see the Response,no crybabies."
Fake News is Al Jazeera*
We have see devastating consequences from Russia already what next??? Possibly nothing
For russia everything shot down. They always lie lol.
Stop war russia
Dont cry and say Putin Is evil when Russia retaliate.Clown country Ukraine.
Putin promised to demilitalise Ukraine since 3 years ago but it looks like Ukraine is now more militarized than ever
Ukraine has a right to defend itself.
Russians go home
Zelenskyy keeping Ukraine in martial law with this strike. Total dictator
It’s easy to attack based on your powerful weapons on the country less powerful by all means but when the attack comes on your backyard we saying zelensky is playin tennis game. War should be stopped but Russia with excuses to take the strategic areas like Crimea for his port and now Donbas. Poor us what the ugly world we live and bring our kids in it
Western critics will say those arent civilian casualties...
Wow the stupidity level in this comment section is of the charts. Plus there is lots of fascist ruzzian sheep as well.
Boris Johnson .You shame the russian
Russian bots are on pay today
poor air defense of the 2nd most powerful country
Putin needs to stop talks and let his men do the talking
its strange the Russian people are OK with having a president that legit kills others who try to better Russia... its one of the only countries who legit has a murderer for a president
Russians get to experience for a few hours what Ukrainians experienced for 3 years.Boo hoo! Cry me a river!
300 drones and over 12 people killed. this channel as usual trying to make Russia less favorable
Shame on you for not mentioning the alwaites that are being slaughtered in the thousands by the Syrian Islamic radicals.
Zelensky attacked regions of Russia with drones at night - almost all of these drones hit and were shot down.. some simply hit high-rise buildings. all drones were filled with steel balls.. clearly not for attacking military facilities.. several children and civilians died.. And all so that they would remember the expired drug addict from Ukraine
Only a fool supports Russia.
Why are the comments on this channel always full of bots. You are owned it seems.
Wow! Ukraine using NATO and American weoapns attacking civilian facilities in Russia?
Russia should stop all peace talks and continue defending itself from NATO. Dont make peace with the devil
This is exactly what they were doing to Donbas for 8 years. They are just filled with hate and want to kill all Russians. This cant be allowed to go on.
Its funny to me that russia has huge nuclear capabilities but they cant shoot down some drones!! Why is there are no anti drone systems in all the towns? I dont get it
Uncle Sam’s obsession with dominance isn’t good for humanity.
this does look like a well thought through long-term strategic plan by a comedian.
550 Million Europeans cant stop 140 million russians
Thats it Russian likely to attack now European countries?
THese are purely terrorists attack that do nothing to advance Ukraines positions
Zelenskys back is itching and needs scratching
Both ukraine and russia have resorted to terrorist attacks on each other
Christianity brotherhood manifestation
I dont want see tears and moaning when Russia responds zelenski must think hes playing tennis
Ukrainian agony.
"It seems that without BIdens &quotarms with restrictions&quot policy, the gloves are off for Ukraine. They hit refineries much harder than before too."
Totally uncalled war
This all propoganda from kyiv regime. No need to attack moscow when your soldiers are on backfoot and running for their lives
Ukraine is my most ridiculous country that has existed since 2014
Bravo ukrain
"I find it funny how pepple support ukraine and play the victim card, yet instead of looking for peace on a BADLY losing war, ukraine chooses to make stupid decisions like this and make things worse for themselves."
"Western countries stop behaving like Gazans, we are better than that"
"RUSSIA !!! LEAVE UKRAINIANS LAND AND GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY . BE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE . STEALING OTHER PEOPLE LAND IS NOT WISE . STOP KILLING EACH OTHER . MEN ARE VERY CHILDISH , NEVER LISTENS . ALL THE PROBLEM HAPPENING IN THIS WORLD ONLY FOR MEN . ALL THE MEN , SHOULD JOIN FARMING , FISHING , CLEANING , PAINTING , FACTORY WORK , BUILDING ETC . PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ANY WEAPON . YOU CAN GUARD YOUR OWN COUNTRY TOO BUT DO NOT TRY TO KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE AND DO NOT DROP A BOMB TO OTHER COUNTRY . WHY WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE GOING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF MEN ?? WHY ?? WHY ?? WE WANT AN ANSWER NOW !!!!!!!!!!! FED UP OF MEN ."
"Ukrania was occupied by rusiya like as issrel occupied palestine, as isarell occupied syria and lebonan."
Yup putin will now attack back and people will blame trump
"IZZrael has firebombed Australian Jew1sh businesses, homes and syn@gogues. Australia@n intelligence agencies have identified IZZRAAELS M0ssa@d as the agency recruiting criminals over the internet to firebomb Jew1sh places in Australia and is paying them with crypto currencies to try to avoid detection. However, Australias ASIO and other intelligence agencies months ago identified IZZrael as the state actor behind these terrorist actions, but have suppressed this information to try to avoid international fallout."
Did Ukraine think this will change the outcome of the war ? This is the last desperate attack
pop goes the weasel FU pootin
incoming saliva urine bots..
Cover the news from Hampi India also…
This comedian is a jew and he does not want peace
Why attack residential areas?
hoorahh about time this is the only langauge putin undestands.
Whatever Ukraine Tries It Will Never Change The Outcome of the war UKRAIN has lost this war
This will have devastating consequences
"This war is not the first one where Russia shows inhuman brutality, cruelness: I found this episode in my family tree, a brother to my ancestors.&quotHans Boije of Tirmula became the castle lord at Wittensten, Estonia in 1571 and bravely defended this fortress against the Russians and after its conquest was put on a spear and roasted alive (January 1, 1573"
"Its important to mention that the Ukrainian government has been bombing these Ukrainian cities / regions since 2014, Donbass, Donetsk and Lygansk"
Omg how could Trump be on Putin side and say that he wants peace omg omg
"USA and Russia secretly signed to invade Russia all over Europe and will index into Russia and USA invade Canada,Panama,Mexico,Iceland and Greenland and will index into USA?"
“Russia has the right to defender itself”
"President Trump is one of the most heartless leaders on the earth. He has forced Ukraine to negotiate with Russia. This is a heartbreaking decision for Ukraine and people who are sympathetic with Ukraine. He should not cut military and intelligence support for Ukraine at this moment. However, instead of supporting Ukraine, a victim country, he provides a strong support for an aggressor country. He should have learned a lesson with Afghanistan. It was his decision to negotiate the agreement with the Taliban. But he blamed Biden for the failed withdrawal. Trump made a big mistake from the beginning."
"soldiers are exhausted,EU chiefs want to push the war forward,I think with time they will have to fight as soldiers themselves"
It was Ukraines doing because the area was already under Russian control.
Obama Biden thats the reason for the war in Ukraine !!!
Peaceful Christian’s
All Russia wants from Ukraine is not to join NATO as it is a dangerous terrorist outfit which brings wars to its borders.
Man what the heck!
"Pointless war , very sad so many have to suffer becomes some rich guys can’t get along"
Those Russians &amp there Shovels powdered by chinese washing machine parts are at it agian
"Zelensky brought this situation to Ukraine, he simply thrown Ukraine into flames, Ukraine will not be the same forever.... after all Russia is his immediate big neighbour and old aquitance, culture, names everything is in fusion...then why he is opting for NATO...grave mistake..."
Right now Putin has the green light to continue the killing of the civilians people and the world can’t do anything and Zelensky got tied hands
"Trump. You need to end this soon. Don’t just yell at Zelenskyy, figure it out with him…"
"Its funny how many people who still pop in these towns shattered by fighting, who waiting for liberation by the Russians- why havent western media ever interviewed any of them?..."
Biden did this problem.
Hey wheres my comment
"Stop making rumours, Russia been out of missiles since 2022"
Russia terrorist country
It all started with Russia opposing Ukraine joining the EU.
Al Jazeera picked the wrong side and their narrative is crumbling just like in Syria. Lesson in journalism kids ~ report without bias and your audience will respect you.
"consequence of delusional war mongering europeans and zelensky, they think they can defeat russia and push them back.... More deaths, more destruction and more territories lost!"
Trump has blood on his hands
What about Palestinians? Continue to tell about Israel’s genocide on Gaza and the West Bank
Was there hamas in these buildings?
Strange how history repeats itself
Bravo Russia.
This is the price of a promise joining NATO
Get ready Lithuania
"Why keep quiet about,what the Kiev regime is doing gorlovka."
"she was given evacuation corridors to leave,what she talking about"
Very harrowing
Zelinsky holding power canceled election that short midget
This is Donbass. It is now Russian Federation. This is a fact whether anyone likes it or not. Ukrainians should thank the NATO for trying to get closer to the Russian borders. Only a moron can not expect such a response from Russia.
"People are dieing in multiple countries right now,People die evert day, Ukraine think they are the only ones suffering and dieing."
The media won’t tell you Ukraine attack Russian oil refinery a day before.
SHE CAN MOVE TO POLAND WITH THE OTHER BANDERA LOVERS
Where is the European intelligence like they dont have it or Satellite such bullshit . Keep holding Meetings
Now imagine Gaza experiences every day of this
So this French intelligence coverage seems to be very useful right....
Why does Trump keep talking about videos of dead babies on both sides?? Why does he threaten Zelensky when its his people that Putin is murdering? Russia is the only one that has ever targeted civillians the entire time. It makes no sense.
Always the Civilians die by Russian attacks.I wonder why Ukraine army is facing shortage of men problem !!!
Ukraine should stop using civillian infrastructure to how its soldiers and foriegn mercenaries.
"ALLAHU Akbar leaves Ukrainia I plan to investigate the truth,what cause the war,who prevented Ukrainia from sign the peace deal,who overthrow the true legitimacy president,trump said if he was the president,maybe he should have force the Zelenskyy regime to sign take the deal,but the democrats thinks the other way,Ukrainia becomes proxy against Russian,Nolan she turn Ukrainian as proxy against Russian,the downfall of Malaysia civilians flight blaming Russia for Obama sanctions,those innocent civilians families demands justice,for their love"
"looks like just russians attack, who you wanna fool, russian dying every day, what you wanna prove that russia is great, russia is losing a lot of soldiers and equipment,...yeah keep talking for one side only, naive will believe you."
"They forgot what Ukraine did to Russian speaking people in dombass 14,000 killed. Were was the west then..."
"Well, I guess jzelenski of jukraine really screwed up this time! Didnt he now?"
Terribly sad for all involved. STOP the war! Peace for all
Ukraine said they will fight to to the last Ukranian standing. Remember Biden and Boris are enjoying being out of office.
the legacy of Zelensky and Banderites Maidan will be forever a stain of Ukraine
"What I don’t understand is why the rest of the world, including Europe and China to name just two, don’t just end it. Is it because Putin says it would be an act of war? Is that how the protocol works… Russian can launch an attack on an independent country and every country just stands around and says “we are with you”…. But they don’t do anything. Every human life lost in this war is a tragedy."
Was it Russia or Ukraine that’s been bombing cities in the Donetsk? Of course they’ll always blame Russia
Slava Ukraine!
Who was really in those buildings?
Why is goin on are they goin to stop this war this pointless
Tacan broj je 25 mrtvih
Anybody that supports the continuation of the war is complicit
"Its war, strange.... news show how Ukraine been bomb, what about Russia? Both side have damage. Ukraine not victim, Expired Zelenskie choice to fight till last man died. Dont blame Russia..."
War isnt pretty
"The soldier wants peace, but the EU wants to keep it going."
Ukrainians should demand elections and get rid of their current leadership which continues to fail them
Russia stato terrorista nazista
Zalinskiy should resign and restore who your true allies are.
Terrorists government is Syria is committing genocide against Alawite and Christians.
Tell me that Trump/USA are indirectly killing Ukrainians - without telling me that Trump/USA are NOW KILLING UKRAINIANS
Isnt Donbass region inhabited by Russians ? Why would Putin bombard his own people - this is an old video
"If the EU does not ensure Ukraines survival with extensive military support, then thanks to Trump, Putin will have millions of new soldiers conscripted from Ukraine to invade Europe with. And Trump will leave NATO so as not to be legally obligated to assist Europe after Putins invasion of Europe. The only chance the EU has of defeating Putin is NOW, after Russia has been weakened from 3 years of war with Ukraine."
Taiwan better be watching
Al Jazeera must be banned for doing propaganda for ISIS and Al Qaeda in Syria and Nazis in Ukraine.
Innalillah waiinaillahirojiun
So sad
20 people? what a pity. But Putin is still nice compared to the Hitler of our time.
So sad to see how the innocent civilians are suffering .World leaders are nothing but war-mongers.
No concessions = No peace
"I cannot afford to lose my hard won trophies for anything, unless you are stupid."
Russia loves death
"Problem is Russia will never give up what they took as Crimea , Donbas etc. allows them naval bases...choking out Ukraine and Nato...leaving Odessa the only Ukraine port....which they will try taking also to lock in Ukraine. Stalemate..."
"Russia promising no concessions of land should be completely unacceptable and a non starter for peace talks.. The world has agreed that. The Ukraine is a sovereign independent country.. just because Putin doesnt believe that doesnt make it true. Vladimir Putin is calling the economic and military bluff of the international community and they are showing signs of backing down in the fight over the fundamental civilized premise that you cant invade and take land anymore. The largest powers in the world have the responsibility to make sure that he understands he cannot win this war, even if it means calling HIS bluff an escalating the military conflict and handing him his cohones just like the world did with the last few thugs who tried to invade other countries. Nobody really wants war but its that important because it will only continue to embolden him more just like the Minsk II agreement when they were not even held accountable for invading Ukrainian land in 2014. IDK maybe Europe and United states can tag team and take turns funding the Ukraine every couple of years until he quits or dies."
"If Russia wanted peace, it would stop fighting"
Who cares what Russia says? Its a small weak economy and is on the brick of disaster. This will be settled on the battlefield .
what my citizens dont understand is we created NATO because of the Soviet Union when that collapsed and now its just Russia for more than a half a century weve been saying Russia is bad China is bad why what did they do to us nothing in fact we catch is really intelligent stealing stuff to us all the time but we called an allies you have to say Russia is a threat and China is a threat as physically attacking us no theyre not but they have to say that because that justifies the almost trillion dollar defense budget thats why they say Russia and China is it right when in fact Russia asked to join NATO so many times but we have to say theyre bad to justify that big budget
"No puttin no donald trump now doing kingdom! This time is doing kingdom too devil, but only devil will bring peace kingdom, not donald trump and puttin"
F Russia and communist Trump
russia needs to give the conessions back
"Ukraine is a corrupt country that no longer deserves the support of the United States. The US will not put any military in Ukraine, no need for weapons when the war is over."
Russia doesnt want peace
What about peace for Palestine?? Is DT is afraid of Israel??
"Of course they dont , its all about land grap"
Anyone wants Russia to leave Ukraine is not a pathway to a peace negotiations. But a total defeat for Russia and to accept defeat and go home without nothing.
The spat in the Oval Office was easy to predict by any informed person. The only ones surprised are the ones that feed off the narrative.
now Russia want Israel to give up land
Zelenskyy is best removed or not supported by the Ukrainian people. This silly puppet is setting up Ukraine for debt and/or complete annihilation.
If Russia wanted peace they should stop invading and stealing other Countrys land.
trump is putins punk...Disgraceful..Stabbing the Freedom Fighters in the back..
The only threat is Russia.Russia are the aggressors. Russia is the only reason for war.Everyone else just wants peace and to be friendly to other countries.Russia needs to stop or be stopped.
Idiots star war who ever stong rule the world
"Putin russia is a country rulled by criminals, partnership with US will end soon"
Why usa got out of what they started?
"Kremlin confirms they don’t want peace. Scorched land is more important than Russian lives. Another 500,000 Russian troops kaput this year. Putin the careless grim reaper"
Long Live Russia
Ukraine is following Yugoslavia path.Is breaking up in 7 or more states.
"I believe that Zelensky has to stop wearing an “Enterprise” uniform or Fidel Castro’s guerrila suits, he needs to wear a suit and start ACTING as a SATESMAN."
GIVE UKRAINE ITS LAND BACK
Zelenskyy wants AIPAC protections
Zelenskyy so arrogant that he’s fighting with Nazis.What a shame
Zelenskyy so arrogant that he’s signed with Nazis.What a shame
Russia is firmly in control of captured territories and will not give them up. They did that to protect their military interests due to a major naval base on the black sea and the Crimea. They don’t want the rest of Ukraine. All that is happening now is a bunch of guys are killing each other on a battlefield and a stalemate and it’s gonna keep going on until Zelenskyy decides he’s had enough of getting his own people killed over territories He will never get back. This is what happens when you talk about joining NATO 10 years ago Russia didn’t like that.
Zelensky thinks his a hero being ignorant. EU cannot save Ukraine.
Give them England. Nobody wants England
Americans and Russians should get along just fine there IQ is the same very very low its obvious trump is working with the Russians its like watching the KGB run America
Trump leave Europe to Putin and get Middle East back to Israel and USA Win-win for both Lets see Greater Israel
Zelensky is busy making headlines on daily basis not thinking about Ukrainians who dont sleep coz of drones &amp missiles
Is this a professional balanced reporting or one sided propagandist reporting??
"Ok Trump, gonna talk to Putin the way you did Zelenksyy??? Putin wants &quotpeace&quot but keeps the bombings going? Ok..."
"Who would have thought, negotiations always based on battlefield situation and Ukraine is in pretty bad position there"
A lot of Russian bots and MAGA cultists on here.
"God bless Russian, Glory to Russian in Jesus Mighty Name Amen, Salam Alaikum, wa Alaikum Salaam,,"
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto,Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,"
Russie talk and Speak for Russie only Russie is for defence your Territory and Donbas who is with Russian People and is Russies Land
US siding with a fascist police-state over its old allies is pretty remarkable
"Zelensky is losing his land every day, but he doesnt care. People are being killed every second, but he doesnt care. He is a symbol of ignorance. He doesnt know the value of human lives."
Wow see how Russia so clean
Im so so so happy with Trump right now. Ive wanted to cut our American involvement day 1
"If Russia invades Europe ,We will sure to be sure to censored by uncaring unjust oppressors, people will be sent to prison for memes and posts on Facebook ( just like britain and Germany). Our traditions and culture and national identity will be surely be demonised/eroded by our would be Ruskie Oppressor. Foreign rape gangs will surely run amok unchecked by the law, Our citizenry will subjected to weekly terrörist attacks by uncaring administrators (like france , britain and germany etc).The democratic process be surely usurped by perfidious Russians (*like Romania is right now by Eu).We might have to live in a two tier legal system which might look different from and be anaethema to our globalist Overlords like Blackrock and vanguard and World Economic Forum"
Peace all over the World. Stop the Zionist Propaganda and wars.
Never mess with Russia
Ww3. Lol.
Ukraine has lost. Only in Europe can a loser expect to win a prize.
What peace guarantee while still at war?
Thats because Zelensky acting like an idiot at the oval office which makes Russia feels like they have option
Glory to Russia...hi ya
Russian junkies
"How about Gaza peace.Why the Europe ignore it totally.Means peace is choosing its skin, colour, religion."
Ukrainian conscripts in shambles all putin needs to do is drop leaflets of surrender before the onset of ammo shortage
Trump is dead about thinking gaza peace agreement
Ukraine should commit to neutrality and Russia should leave Ukraine and give back ALL Ukrainian land including Crimea.
"Europe will save it, with words"
Russia has its own principle as all countries have and I believe if others can respect Europe security than they must respect Russian security and borders too or not it will become like what Ukraine face today . Ukraine.
"europe doesnt care about the plight of ukraine people, they only think about business..war is business...end of war means loss of money for them..who thinks europe will help for free means you are a very stupid person..zelensky doesnt understand this game, ukraine is only used as a chess board"
Ukrain have no choice if US stop support
"ok, no need negotiate anymore"
TRUMP IS THE BEST PRESIDENT
Trump championing &quotpeace&quot by giving a handout victory to the enemy is insanity. I cannot believe people still fall for this guy.
We told zelensky to look for peace not wepons
"I really dont care, especially after how Ukraine had Trump energy towards the South African president. With that said I dont like War, and Ukraine should fight for their land"
Im sending trump a white feather for his cowardice in bowing down to the Russian dictator.
So ukraine can keep kursk?
These EU and UK crazies still dont get it. The war is lost by Ukraine. The victor dictates the terms.
Absolutely amazing!! I knew Trump would make this right!....
All Im hearing is signing a &quotpeas&quot deal
Peace on Russian Terms.
Trump is a weakling.
"Get used to the idea that Trump has already sold Europe to Russia in exchange for Canada, Greenland, Mexico... etc. Is it hard to count the warheads and observe the behavior of Trump and Musk?"
"As trump said, ukraine holds no cards"
"Only two big guys only.Do they are big enough? Cry baby cry ,Later europe also will follow."
"They say, Russia doesnt get to dictate how Ukraine draws its borders. Likewise, Kiev doesnt get to dictate how Crimea prefers to be governed."
"No one cares what they think. They invade sovereign countries, and their leader is a wanted war criminal. Give Ukraine its land back!"
"Russias not looking for peace, its looking for victory. If they were genuinely looking for peace they would leave Ukraine. Blaming the rest of Europe for not wanting peace is an excuse. How will weakening Ukraines position ensure peace? It will only strong arm them into accepting whatever terms Russia and America dictate, they want to plunder Ukraine. Zelensky should do a mineral deal with the EU, then they can go to the negotiation table and see if Russia or America accept such a deal."
Victory for Russia well done Putin zelenski is doomed w it th his country
These guys dont want anything even before negotiating but they are busy stressing Ukraine to agree to a deal you wonder which one
It vowed this in 1996 as well.....
"Russia is in no position to demand anything, their armys and equipment are seriously depleted and their b economy is on its knees."
Orange Man is biggest coward in US history
"If Isreal have the rigth to invade palestine ,Russsia have the rigth to turn ukraine to Russia,thats common sense"
"Ukraine is a part of Europe, not belongs to Russia."
Giving Ukraine land to Russia would be the same as giving Gaza land to Israel
Russia always open for peace negotiation..russia never try to threat other country but under the puppet zelensky broke the lines that promised by nato for not to expand to the east..now ukrainian are wiping tears everyday beacuse of the stupidity of zelensky the thrown away puppet
"You cant deal with Putin hes expectations are just ridiculous Ukraine must fight on and best them With the support of Europe The US is out, Trump is a Russian asset One or another <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGWduQvkDXo&ampt=114"">1:54</a> Putin and his equally Evil enablers are unbelievable Slava Ukraine"
With Russians it always black is white and white is black. Who wants to continue the war? Maybe the one who invaded? :)
"The United States may refrain from engaging in discussions regarding the Ukraine conflict for several more days.Following intense discussions with President Zelensky in the Oval Office, President Trump expressed significant disappointment.This raises questions about the understanding of the wars ramifications, particularly as a substantial portion of Ukraine has transformed into a desolate area.As the leader of the nation, what measures is he taking to halt this conflict? Despite three years of turmoil, there has been no tangible outcome. How can Ukraine maintain hope for a victorious resolution? He owes answers to both Ukraine and the global community.If this situation persists, it is likely that even after a decade of conflict, there will be no resolution, only extensive losses on both sides. Therefore, why not seek to end it now?During his campaign, Donald Trump assured the American public that he would work to end the war in Ukraine and prevent further bloodshed on both sides. This inhumane conflict is unnecessary in a civilized world. After his election, he initiated efforts to bring this war to a close.Whether one believes it or not, the global community is recognizing Trumps endeavors to achieve peace.While mineral extraction may not hold significant importance for the United States, the pursuit of peace on this planet remains paramount."
"Europe will save it, with words"
Ukraine’s ambitions to join NATO and EU/US efforts to mess up with Russia’s neighbourhood lead to this mess.
"I really love him and his Country🇪🇦, which is much closer us... Mediterranean &amp warm-blooded"
Great russia.. ukraine is part of russia whats the big deal .like canada is part of usa and others
Another Trumpist
No. <i>One</i> war they want to keep going ...
"And Qatar too, given how youve gifted him a jet."
America.. part of the Axis of evil
Is the UN actually going to do something about this conflict or just continue to allow Putin to get away with what he is doing?
Good!This is all former us governments fault and EU.They took the war to Ukraine.Supporting the nazis opression of ethnic Russians.
The US was in Afghanistan for twenty years. Why should this surprise?
This war never was for Ukraine freedom. It was always about getting money. Hundreds of billions has been spent already with no benefit. Ukraine is the project and the failed one. It is time to cut expenses and save what can be saved. Simple.
Trump must have sincerely fall in love with putin and kim jong un bromance
This is unbelievable
Traktor 300
"Guess Freedom gives up. Nee World Order option aggressor takes all, always again."
Alright who turned of historical accuracy in HOI4?
biden started it by undoing trumps rule thanks obama
"America mirroring Germany, oh how the times have changed."
Dont trust US while trump is on presidency.
I think USA has finally waken up that enough is enough. I think Ukraine should just accept the terms of peace and stop fighting.
"Here we go boys, Axis 2.0 vs Commonwealth of Europe"
FUN FACT: 1939-1941 America ignores Europe and sides with the bad guy. 2024-2028 America ignores Europe and sides with the bad guy
wow South africa was in favor. thats a change
We start liking US after a long time. And we are from Vietnam
The US has always been on the strong side and pretend to be a winner at the end.
"EU need US to fight their fight , they needed US during 1st and 2nd WW as well ."
Its clear Europe and UN evil organisation wants the war continues its clear Europe is behind zelenky and become the New USA enemy every one know zelenky started the The war by introducing weapons from NATO and USA during jobiden that is why Trump is disagree well done 👍
A lot of Trump supporters don’t understand why we stand with Ukraine because they speak a foreign language in Ukraine.
All those who voted no are on side of common sense. The other group is afraid and outdated mentality that has the world in its current atate
that the problem of trump administration. his good of something but not perfect as a president of US his align with russia means give up the piece of land the russia occupied that not gonna happen. even if the russia take the land of ukraine stil cannot manage to use that resistance people of ukraine will fight for there country. much better biden even if there corruption stil his a good allience with other country. his balance the situation
"just like how they changed the name of Wuhan. virus, China. virus to Covid to make China happy. Now they want to not acknowledge that Russia is the aggressor. This world is corrupt to the core."
The Resolution carried easily.
It wasn’t Russia that expanded toward NATO’s borders—it was NATO that moved eastward toward Russia’s doorstep.
"No one understands ,the US anymore"
Did they mention how corrupt Ukraine was and still is
Wonders shall never end. USA On same side as north korea lols
stupidity at its best!!! America you deserve trump
i think us is prepping itself for china
You think these people will just FORGET???
"its normal, US dont have friends, just Geopolitical interest and that can change in any moment.Ukraine was a interest for Biden and warmongers in US to try to destroy Russia, but that idea is just a old way of view everthing from old-mens from 80 , who just hate blindy the URSS and later Russia.Trump now know Russia can be a powerful ally vs China, so hes taking the bet."
Enough! We do not need to take sides. We dont need to finance wars. Helping end it isnt a bad thing.
Israel is waving
New Axis of Evil 🇺🇲🇷🇺🇮🇱
"Russia isnt the aggressive, Ukraine should have followed through the first time they started provoking territorial agreements which again puts the occupation of Kyiv front and center. Russia deserves a great amount of territory but UN and China wants Russian and Ukraine territory to themselves"
unreal.... the US is a joke now. pathetic.
"Yalta 2.0: Trump, Putin and Xi. The three ya shall decide what to do with the rest of the morons on the world. What a joke US, What have you done !!!"
"So proud of USA, standing on the right side of history! Finally!"
Thank you Mr Trump
Imagine China and Russia bringing weapons and an army to Mexico. That is Ukraine becoming part of NATO. Not a fan of Putin but understand the situation. Also we are in a middle of a negotiation to end the war. This vote only complicates everything.
"The real question is why did it take 3 YEARS to ever put this to a vote? If it was to gain the proper evidence, then one would think that the tanks rolling right into Ukraine the very first day were a dead giveaway. Shows how absolutely useless the UN truly is!"
The entire comment section is full of joy
She needs to dress
Difference between voting a politician or a businessman
USA IS FIRDT WESTERN COUNTRY TO BECOME COMMUNIST COUNTRY.
The US abstained from voting on its own resolution? Huh? The UK and France didn’t use their vetos?Has the world gone mad?
Soviet USA lol
Does this make America great yet?
Based!!!! Good choice
Well trump has successfully blackmailed tech giants and they all now server under him and has bended Ukraine to agree to a deal without Ukraines terms. All hail emperor trump lmao
Cant imagine Mr. Zelensky face on that day. The staffs had to cope with his anger issues
"Will Israel have to pay back US for arms it was sent, whats good for Ukraine surley is good for Israel"
even china
"I am 50s, seeing the shifting of geopolitical nowdays is like roller coster ..."
"This disgust me beyond belief. Please change from US to Trump votes with Russia, Iran, North Korea"

"&quotJeffrey Sachs: EU Panics as Peace Breaks Out &quot type in the search, He tells us who organized this war, and who is constantly lying."
"…Keep smilin, keep shinin Knowing you can always count on me for sure.Thats What Friends Are For"
youtube is big liar and media is lying!
&quotA genuine enemy is more useful than a fake friend&quot
Adults are trying to end the war. UN has done nothing over the years. What use will it be calling Russia names whiles the parties are trying to Negotiate
Nato started it
USA has changed NOW to USR (United States of Russia) and you have a commander in black mailer chief and one in Europe will help you when you go to war with china and you will need help
"Yes it was not so long ago when the US together with its western colonial powers voted for and won the majority resolution at the UN, labelling Putin a &quot War Criminal&quot and the Russian army and its governmental officials guilty of war crimes. Hypocrisy of the US is clear to see for all, not to say the rest of the western powers are any less guilty of causing and funding this 3 year long war which could have been easily avoided."
UN loves wars.
But Russia is not on Ukraine territory.Russia is on the territory of the 4 new independent Republics. Ukraine is following Yugoslavia dismembering example.
"Lets see how powerful the collective west is without USA, theyre trying to frame Russia, but the real aggressor is NATO, encroaching in its borders violating treaties, instigating internal conflict and pouring weapons for profit, and is still losing."
Trump sold everyone out including our country.
because russia is not the aggressor. NATO is.
that disgusting
Lol now the west get to experience the same feeling when yall voted against ending the Isreal occupation
"these people in delegation has a shame for the rest of their lives, definitely end of their career just when trump will be gone...."
Russia didn’t start this war ! Ukraine did when it welcomed nato on Russias doorstep!!! Good job President Trump 🇺🇸🇺🇸
"its a shame, Putin did start the war and Only he is a war criminal, Trump is just a poor old criminal man and a muppet"
"The USA has become a global disgrace. No longer are they the good guys, they are corrupt, criminal liars."
Trump is a disgrace and a traitor!!!!!!! He is trying to align America with the Axis of Evil but the American people won’t have it!!!!!!!RESIST Trump on EVERYTHING. He must GO!!!!
Lol the pushback from the &quotGlobal South&quot biting them in the back when they tried to stay on their moral high ground.Now US has joined Russia as we shift into a who has the bigger stick rules. It was dumb for US to vote against our interests under the Biden and prior Dems Administrations.
Even Orange power can not save Putin regime.
"The only thing that keeps North Korea in check is RUSSIA ,The only thing that keeps the Middle East in check is Saudi ArabiaUN USAID blew open the arming of militant groups, the US taxpayers DUPED, by the previous admin.UN is anti Jew Christian biasedMajority of Americans need to learn the dynamics of Narco Terrorism, because South of USA, are countries that are already operated with Chinese money. Learn NARCO TERRORISM as you need to learn &quot Social Engineering&quot."
Way to sell us out Trump!!
what is happening America?
"Correct blame is Russia, Ukraine, US, GB, France and Germany."
Trump = global wrecking ball
Oh there nithing like ut when two dictati get together even war crimes can be buried. F u usa and russia
Trump =The Emperor Putin. = Vader Kim jong un = Jabba
"US is Now side with China,Russia and North Korea. Trump You are a disgrace, coward and Traitor to the American people and our Allies. You stand with Dictatorship, not Democracies."
This is what happens when billionaires unite to DICTATE
Thats brutal. Just shows u how money buddys DICTATE...
The US is busy on peace talks not rocking the boat like these stupid meetings try to do. Trump will win he always does.
"The power of the Holy Spirit الل is with President Trump, saving the World from The Horror of future Dictator Zielinski. (Ref: Luke 24:49)"
Shame on this American woman.
Trump puppets
Now we need to see imprisonments of leaders that organized and funded this &quotObama/Clinton&quot war!
Somebody needs to tell her that Ukraine hasnt been a thing since the United States overthrew the government in 2014 and put a cross-dressing stand-up comedian as military president whose only experience is acting as president on tv. And they havent had elections since.
This is another one big one
Trump is a TRAITOR TO THIS COUNTRY!
"Putin must not forget his colour ,and i believe he definitely spray that colour everywhere (Red) , be carefull when shake hand with trump , this is honoured for many who lost there lives and love one sure."
Americans have been forewarned but Them are FOOLS
US now is a Putin Puppet
"Russia invaded Ukraine, but prior to the invasion Ukraine national militias carried out pograms against ethnic Russians. That never gets talked about anymore."
Us just turned their back against Ukraine
Its all business people. Its just good business.
Now people will understand why Congo is in turmoil because of such votes.
Trump is friend with Putin and Kim.
Usa is an industrialised state and Russia is resources rich state . Both can flourish their self with cooperation.western Europe has eaten put enough usa tax payer money by making Russia a villian with their news outlets. This decade is of usa Russia friendship in greater good of world.
The aggressors are NATO and Ukraine dont you understand?
Three years of European and US capitalists hunger for war industry and expansion of fascist NATO
"US, Russia, Israel, three of the same kind, are finally in the same group"
The Clowns Party is Over Period.
"Mann kann die UN auflösen, da Sie sich von Ihren Werten verabschiedete !!!!Europa kuscht wieder einmal vor den USA !!!!Europa wieder nicht einig ,Trump erzählt jetzt so und in einer Woche weiß Er von nichts mehr !!!!Weder Europa noch die Ukraine oder alle anderen Staaten können den USA oder Russland trauen !!!!"
"The number of member states is misrepresentative, China alone has 52 European state population so their one vote is equivalent to half the &quotyes&quot voter"
Happy Longlive long n bless Dear Members of UN parliament
3 years of Ukraine’s corruption
Traps for russia... May Allah protect Russia against these evil beings
America scared
"The U.S. made Ukraine a proxy thus started the war. Learn the history please! The coup, the violation of the Minsk accords and the clear demarcation of Russia’s red lines."
Anyone depending on America should learn Saudi Arabia haha
"Trump is making new friends. I love it. Finally, some new drama in world politics."
"It’s official, America has joined the alliance of Rat Bastards."
"I see what Trump and Putin are up too, both are realizing the threat of China haha"
people cry about trump because no more money for them
"God bless Russian, Glory to Russian in Jesus mighty Name Amen, Salam alaikum, wa alaikum salaam,"
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto Sardegna Napolitano Napoli America Rome"
America politic are such a two face. cannot be trust.
The EU gets used for nothing .
now peoples not say USA have double standards on Russia and Israel at UN
Finally! What an historic moment. Trump wasnt bluffing after all. I despise the guy but the guy has balls.
Trust in the strategy
Why don’t they vote to have Israel remove itself from territories in Syria and Lebanon? What about the US occupying 1/3 of Syria?
Dont forget Israel and what are they thinking they experience holocaust but allowed Ukraine to be destroyed
US Eu relations were fine. Trump stabbed EU in the back.
You just voted to approve the massacre of thousands of Ukrainian citizens
"We left Czechoslovakia in 1968, after the Soviet led invasion. We can hardly be accused of sympathy for that regime. However times changed. Ukraine is now a fascist and most corrupt country. Russia is free and advanced a lot towards a democratic state. What would be wrong if USA, Canada and others would recognize that and cooperate with Russia to build a better world ? Do we want a world war? Idiots like Biden gang and Trudeau and EU with Soros and other military crazy people want exactly that."
What a disgrace you are to the American people 🇬🇧
UN + WEF = 4TH REICH. THE US MIDDLE CLASS IS DONE BEING THE WORLDS TAX FARM. WE ARE DONE WITH CONQUEST UNDER THE GUISE OF SAFETY. EUROPE CAN STICK IT!
Told you the trump leaderahip is an effective lapdog of Putin. US is owned by Russia!
The Président Trump need a big support
Because we are no longer drinking the Ukraine/innocent kool aid. The narrative in this is suspicious at best and corrupt at worst.
Can someone explain why the USA is paying the bill for the EUs expansion into Ukraine?
Lol Europeans
"AFTER THE WAR , UKRAINE WOULD STOCK PILE AND MANUFACTURE ARMS FOR SURE NEVER BEEN SEEN IN HISTORY..UKRAINE WOULD BE POWERHOUSE IN ARMS AND DRONES MANUFACTURING AND YEARS TO COME THEY COULD GET CRIMEA BACK. MORE POWERFUL THAN ISRAEL"
"USA - RUSSIA - NORTH KOREA - CHINA - HUNGARY, side by side. What a punch in the guts, this is called BETRAYAL , this is TREASON. UK and FRANCE needed to veto this resolution and stand against dictators."
"I Love New/Old Ways of Thinking , Its Spreading like COVID-19 .Make sense and Open Brither Future for All People, not only from &quotDem-O-CRAcY&quot Be-lie-ve-rs 🇺🇦1) Boris Johnson, British torpedo Peace , ORDER to the NATO Mercenary and Zieliński to &quotEXTENDED&quot war in Ukraine when Zieliński was ready to negotiate Peace in May, 2022.2) 8 September 2022 On Thursday, US Secretary of State Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Blinken traveled to Ukraine to pledge to fight Russia &quotTO THE LAST UKRAINIAN&quotAmerican and British warsmagers provided , REASONS&quot and &quot MOTYWATION&quot to keep war with Russia going after breaking Over end Over Mińsk Agreement. Globalists Corporate Elites&quot Must Keep alive &quotNever Ending Wars&quot, with Russia trying to In-Slave Russia Federation by IMPERIALISTIC corporations forces."
"For the first time ever, i think he is technically right . I have been travelling the globe for 5 years and i understand that during the of the Cold War the agreement was to have a nuetral country inbetween to avoid conflict However, NATO does the same as the Europeans always have, expanding &amp arming any country they possibly can. With ukraine fully armed, due to the local geography, russia would be at a MAJOR disadvantage if Ukraine began attacking, so Putin technically did what he had to do for self-preservation, even if its immoral .Yes Putin and his governance are corrupt,but so is the West. Poor ukraine is being used as a proxy war to prolong the Cold War,when they would've been safe from these attacks if the west didnt insert Zelensky to push for ukraine to be armed &amp brought into NATO"
As ever US politics cant be trusted.
"USA, Russia, North Korea, Hungary, Belarus - Crème de la crème"
USA became officially an abomination
You need to work with both sides to attain a peace deal. Name calling and the blame game towards any side will deter that effort and cause continued carnage.
"The U.S. is not the policemen of the world. We started this war in 2014, and we lost it in 2021. Time for a new path forward where the United States of AMERICA focuses on the AMERICAN hemisphere."
"What ever....war is ending, peace is coming..... thats great"
"A country whose already been sanctioned, condemned, and isolated will not back off with placards of protests from the UN or the world!"
"Tell me you love communist,without telling me you love communism… Trump : well …"
Wars don’t end with moral posturing. What is the use of naming Russia as an aggressor? Will it help or will it just intensify the conflict? What are you up to now? WW3? This is not the time for blame but to negotiate for peace.
Putin had got to have some real good gold en show er pics on trump
"The UN has a wise, neutral opinion in this conflict between two former Soviet republics.Russia and Ukraine have been arguing since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since 2014, Ukraine has even been fighting its own people in eastern Ukraine militarily.It was not until 2022 that Russia came to the aid of the people in eastern Ukraine.Nobody can blame just one side because both are to blame for the war.And that is exactly what the UN Assembly and the Security Council have confirmed.All incitement against either side is inappropriate.What we need is understanding and finally peace again!"
The USA is a fuckng joke
It is monumentally silly for USA to support Russian war criminals
"hello all idiots, the US is trying to end the war now… why cant you support US this time or maybe another European idiot going to Ukraine to and tell Zelensky to continue the war"
When are people going to understand that USA government only look after their interests
US wanna take Russia on his side to be against China thus ignoring Europe.
I knew this would happen when MAGA put Trump in what is now the White Kremlin
"America couldnt, trump already said otherwise, and he cant ever be wrong."
"The US did not agree us the people do not agree. This is our government turning their back on democracy and bowing down to dictators. Russia is the obvious aggressor, and the one that started the war the US is corrupted it’s sad to say that America has lost its mind"
Putin appreciates Trump’s support. They are becoming best friends.
Ukraine President was fool
Well done USA. The madness has to stop. The Russians in eastern Ukraine need a voice.
Putin now owns the world
Europe panicking now that their dad is no longer on their side
He is a traitor a convicted criminal
The U.S. is currently trying to negotiate with Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine. It makes sense to not publicly offend Russia during such negotiations.
Trump is Putin puppet they run him he is Putin asset and spy
Zelensky must no make deal with trump no mineral for USA Deal with European leaders they do have ammunitions and nukes Trump is not for trust he proved many time Ukraine risk of lose mineral and territory Keep him away
Zelensky must no make deal with trump no mineral for USA Deal with European leaders they do have ammunitions and nukes Trump is not for trust he proved many time Ukraine risk of lose mineral and territory Keep him away
"Mark this as FACT: WWII had 3 Axis powers. In 2025, there is a new Axis power: RUSSIA, N KOREA, and the USA. Wt serious f."
What a joke
"no doubt, putin is the idol of trump. putin is the big dictator and trump is the small dictator."
Horrible country. Please everyone unite against King Drumpf.
WOW! I didnt know this is a WOKE channel...adios
US is a disgrace....Im ashamed to be American
USA is now a Russian asset.
This Ukrainian lady forgot to mention the fact that her government bombed its own population. Strange that.
"She looks rather sheepish,,and so she should refusing to condemn Russia for the invasion."
Shameless usa
"Dont forget, rebuild"
Not the US. Trump. Our dictator criminal.
Finally!!! No Globalism anymore! No unipolar world! Cold war is over.
The irony is that israel also voted against ukraine
"now for those of you in the fragmented west theres still time to obey China and Russia, or else"
taiwan is next
"When you become the U.S enemy, you bare your face to its punches. But if you the U.S ally, you expose your back to its knife."
China is the beacon of light in the world!
USA wants Ukraine’s minerals.
"Why is this UN still going on???? Does nothing good, look at Palestine..."
Great to see the US standing up to the WEF puppet states!
"Whats wrong with the U.S, the most democratic, human right defender state on earth ???"
Absolutely disgraceful behaviour from America
A very sad day indeed. Dictators and totalitarian regimes will triumph and the average person will suffer.
Trump moving the USA closer and closer to fascism. Will not end well for him.
"Imagine 3 years persuading everyone to hate russia and vetoing them to all of a sudden sitting there saying oh hey, their the good guy after all all of you that followed us are actually the bad guys. At this point usa just looks stupid as. But the fools who made their countries poor and still trying to carry on are just as silly. Shows this was bidens war all along, as for Europe they got played and dont even seem to see it."
End the war fools!
Usa destroyed a country again. Its a great business of USA. Ignite the war then sell the guns and machineries and then distance yourself. And countries are dumb enough to understand this
What in the actual F**K!!!
Based America 🇺🇸 lfg cry harder leftists
This is a shame
Them Zionist in Israel need to take them selfs to europe For war crimes they committed For over 75 years and more of occupation Plus thats not forget about the genocide
"I saw ideo footage of Eukraines fighting with people in their own country,,,,"
"I whole entire world knows by now who are the real aggressors of this war( obviously Putin), I have amplified this phrase already Trump is a Trojan horse for Putin and his Autocratic party"
Even Russia thinks: wtf
"USA, &quotthe oldest democracy on earth&quot finally losing their PR spin on things"
Because this war was completely provoked by the US policy in Europe and Ukraine
Theyre use to always follow us to vote same way now us voted against them
"Only Five members can Veto , RUSSIA , China , US, France , UK !! SO its 3 against 2. Guess who won!"
Descaful
"the US is becoming an embarassment to the whole world, no ally can depend on them for anything, tariff your friends and closest trading partners, reneg on the FTA agreement that Trump 1.0 signed, cash grab for minerals from Ukraine, rename the gulf, retake greenland, and panama canal, make Canada part of USA, unlawful DOGE firings with MUSKeters, it goes on and on, IMPEACH now"
"Russian troops spent weeks surrounding Ukraine before invading. Putin was willing to negotiate and avoid the invasion, but Ukraine, the USA and NATO actually egged Putin on. They effectively dragged him into war. Of course, now they say that Putin invaded out of the blue and that plans to dominate the world. The hypocrisy is blatant &amp barefaced!"
"Trump had something incorrect. The Ukraine war was not Ukraines fault. It was the fault of George W. Bush and the US for pressing to offer NATO candidacy to Ukraine despite then German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and French PM, Nicolas Sarkozy, warning that it would lead to an international conflict. Had Bush and future administrations listened rather than exude arrogance in dismissing Merkel and Sarkozy, there would not have been a war to discuss."
So this is what democracy is all about?
Usa = terrorist organization
"Theyd know, they have been orchestrating it since at least 2014. First the CIA colour revolution, then provoking the Bear for 8 years, blowing up NS2 to make the EU dependent on US energy and then making Ukraine a debt-vassal via surrendering all the unnecessary military materiel dump..."
"I watched Putins interview today and I felt Putin is speaking very normal and sensible about the present situation and what his stand would be.Thats perfectly understandable and human. But scare mongers spread scenarios of impending Armageddon that is pure fiction and far fetched by idiotic minds.The world is going normal but with some skirmishes that can always be ironed out if people approach them with practical solutions not wild threats and chest thumping. Obvious Trump messed up but it seems Putin has not taken it to his head, he appears humble enough to find solutions provided he is not approached with threats and coercion. We need to be hopeful and expectant not scare mongering and crying wolf always!"
But it was okay for Biden to vote against Palestine
Truly here Russia is the winner ...
"funny to see all the people pretending to not know why Trump voted no on a resolution amended in a way to make peace impossible, whats funny is that it makes you responsible for people who died and will die. But not me since i dont pretend that Trump &quotsided&quot with Putin and Kim Whatever."
NATO is the biggest aggressor for expanding into Russians front yard and is using Ukraine as a proxy to fight Russia by all necessary means that include arming and compensating foreigner Mercenaries from all around the world and Ukranian Neo Nazis and let them do whatever they want.
"Finally, some common sense from the USA"
Britain and France get nothing out of this war. Now mind your own business Mr Macron
Why is Russia even allowed at the UN?? Why hasnt Putin been dragged out back and had his cranium ventilated??
These are world leaders. If they unite there is peace if not...well doomsday welcome
"Someone told me a long long time ago, decades ago, that that all wars are all about money. Dont believe that the fighting is for freedom. Dont believe that the fighting is for nationalism. Dont believe all the lies that they will tell you. Its only about money, and people killing and dying so that other people will get rich. And this really really proves it."
TAD
Ukraine signed the Budapest Treaty. Where security was guaranteed in exchange for surrendering a third nuclear potential. America betrayed. Give Ukraine nuclear weapons or money.
What was going on in east Ukraine before the war?
free palestine
Thanks for voting for American interest. Can’t complain
"take that, zelensky!!"
Sell out!
America is broke and they will do anything to stop spending money!
"The world thought Russia had hit rock bottom, but then the U.S. knocked from below."
Uncle Sam is crying
we got us sides with russia before GTA 6
When did the US ever vote for Russia? We should send Trump to Russia to be a dictator there. He’s not a president for democracy.
"When Ukraine says no to minerals, US says yes to Russia These shameless US Congress members have really no shame at all . They themselves started this war against Russia!"
"I can understand the US abstaining in a bid to preserve its negotiation stance with Russia but to vote against Ukraine with Russia is utter betrayal. We will never trust the US ever again. We fought for America after 9/11. For 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan. If the US is in trouble again, dont call us, we shant pick up."
US and Russia become alliance!
Anyone with some critical thinking skills would deduct that the USA is trying to end the war and does not want to jeopardize that with some insignificant wording on a resolution that has no weight in the outcome of this conflict.
"If China does not use this opportunity to take control over Taiwan, they are making a big mistake. With Russia and the US being new partners, no one cares about Taiwan."
"teach children Dont live in the past, face the world with the spirit of moving forward together"
why should declare agression while the war will ended??? it was past and useless resolution
Trump! Sucks!
Ukraine was betrayed by America...how does it feel?
"To be fair, if you fight a war, you gotta depend yourself to fight, why kept on using other countries’ resources to help? If some people are incapable and kept on asking society’s resources to help, then that’s the problem. You wanna be independent but you can’t be, coz you don’t have the resources yourself, so how to be independent? If your friend for example is super incapable, jobless for years and asked for your help, then what do you do? Pay for him endlessly to help? This doesn’t help, your friend needs to stand up and get a job and be independent, independent means not rely on others’ help to do it. Personally I agree with Trump, incapability and kept on asking for help makes yourself a liability to other people."
Good move we want peace God bless Trump
Russia invaded Ukraine and conquered US
UN is absolutely useless They Palestine they Fail Ukraine they always Fail this doesnt mean Nothing
"This cant be true... IMPOSSIBLE! Trump is undeer Putins shoe , thats sure but... how could the US vote AGAINST THE FACT that russia invaded Ukraine? Americans seriously dont think thats what happened?"
"American here: many of us recognize just how messed up this is. We know how badly weve dropped the ball. Were (or at least I am) protesting, practicing civil disobedience where I can, and trying to inform those who are still under the spell of the orange MAGA pumpkin and his entourage of brain dead lackeys. Im so sorry, europe, our allies, and to the rest of the world. Im sorry."
U didnt sign the peace agreement in 2022. Then u wanted a peace agreement made and signed excluding Russian representitives just last year. What now? What hypocracy ! U dont care about ykranian people suffering. Cos if u did u would lift Martial law that has been imposed since 2022 to silence them. Let them have their democratic say.
"Remember, there were 17 other countries that voted with the US. Not just 2"
Look at all the worthless people in that room
3 years of American tax payers dollars being thrown away!!!!
who cares about the UN ???they are as good as the RED CROSS
i support for russia because NATO enlargement and mr putin has a good speech in munich during 2008 USA did this now USA has to support for the right thing...come on russia
America the cowardly country ….be careful you could be attacked one day and your friends will look away
End the War.....look forward not backward. theres so much to gain. Ukraine will be okay and sovereign in Her Neutrality. Ukraine will thrive again.
Yes this version of USA is indeed disappointing but no less than árabe oil countries and Brics who didn’t dare to go against theirs master’s voice . An agressor .. is an agressor in all dictionaries in the world!!
How come Ukraine abstained from UN resolution? Looks like they still want to keep fighting.
"Thank God , Woke Globalist days are over."
"Lesson for Europe and the world, never ever trust USA"
USA may as well give itself over to Canada. They have no place on the world stage anymore.
The US are now the bad guys.Let there be no doubt.
I cant believe the US people are siding with russia
The president of the US is not capable of anticipating the consequences of the US vote.
"Trump is stupid, all hes interested in is money. Hell bring more choas in upcoming days"
Israel is an aggressor more than what russia is
I didnt believe that one day USA and North Korea will vote the same way....Happy for your new friends Usa....
You guys dont have resolutions.
"Well Ill tell you this much the USA is now even more popular with global South countries than its ever been before, well it looks like the United States is probably going to lift sanctions on Russia and probably even leave the G7 and join the BRICS."
Very good!
Its Putin who started the war.
"Just stop this and other wars ,nobody wins in war ,only people die , everyone that I know wants to live in peace isnt that enough ."
"Russian American imperialism is just disgusting. The fact that the European countries are submitting shows what cowards they are, wagging their tails and submitting to the imperialism of the great powers without protest. The UN security Council is becoming a laughing stock."
Its Trump who voted and not US.
Trump is Russian asset !
"Enhance Your Satisfaction , By Understanding Your Existence …. Se arch EXISTNC"
The US and Russia are new allies until CIA destroys it.
Hehehehehe hahahahahaha lololololololol….. ahhhhahahahaha bahahahaha
Typical American way.
Woahhh does anybody remember this from an episode of madam Secretary except it was France on the episode LOL
America is as naive as a child. They dont know anything about Europe or Russia. They dont understand what they just did. They gave Russia free hands to do whatever it wants to Europe. Ukraine war is about Europe too. Nothings more important for us Europeans than to be independent and not under Russia. Russia is our worst nightmare. To imagine that some country doesnt know it in 2025.
"Ngoahahaha.. Ngono a, Om? Preketek"
"I didn’t vote at all so i am not guilty, also I am not surprised we have a Russian puppet at the White House"
As an American this makes me sick to my stomach.
UN is impotent to do something against ISraeli genocide...
DONALD &quotKRAZNOFF &quotTRUMP IS NOT AMERICA. HE IS PUTINS TOOL.
Trump and Putin are best friends
"The Trump Adminstration is a Clown Show, the lying is so blatant .... do they really expect &quotanyone&quot with 1/2 a brain to believe that Ukraine started the war, like the entire world did not see it play out? Us voting with Putin and Kim? Embarrassing, pathetic joke!"
its really sad and the resoluiton was simple ... to agree taht Russia invated Ukraine and should leave basically ...and the US did not vote for that but Ironically the US has been supported Ukraine most with most money spent...
"Wait, russians believe religiously that they fight US-troops in Ukraine? What exuses will they find for destroying the towns and houses of millions of Ukrainians now?"
"Trump should publicly urge Macron 🇫🇷, Starmer 🇬🇧 and Merz 🇩🇪 to collectively meet Putin ASAP."
the world turned upside down
its time to make a remix on wing of changes
"President Trump, to be candid, you are losing your way.....reevaluate your negotiations with Russia. Russia is truly an aggressor..."
Congratulations to Trump
"God bless Ukraine and Sweden! It´s sick that christians are killing eachother, still in 2020ies... Mercy in the name of Iryna of Kyiv-Rus/St Anna, born in Sweden with eight siblings. Descendants today are probably the Ace of base-siblings.. At least one of them is spiritually gifted, see angels, have precognitions..."
hearing is we voted no but why did we vote no?
"there is something deeper going on here the alignment of our country world. I think we ought to stay clear from this as the war. I don’t understand why we did not vote. Yes, what was in that bill and the war for our interest as well?"
UN is a woke leftist
Free Palestine
USA is scumbag criminal country now
We the American people have spoken TRUMP🇺🇸
Ukraine is done... all have enough of this corrupted liar clown...
"In the USA, insane patients have taken over the psychiatric hospital and are destroying everything, and the leader of the crazy people is Trump"
"No body trusts America now, undependable, untrustworthy, and disloyal!"
"”Its dangerous to be Americas enemy, but to be its friend is fatal.”- Henry Kissinger"
This channel seems to support Ukraine despite Ukraine being seriously accused of nazism with lots of supporting evidence
"Im an American Veteran who, like many others, will resist this wanna be king. Russia is, and has always been, the aggressor against Ukraine 🇺🇦. The truth."
"Now, now everyone! Lets be fair to Donald Trump taking Putins side despite the overwhelming evidence! He really doesnt want that pee tape to come out and humiliate him more than his public actions!"
Wake up europe get the U.S. MILITARY OUT NOW
Lol you all believe that news? That’s so funny
Israel voted against :)
"Ukraine will be a part of Russia. With EU going down, money laundering, racism, russophobia and war will stop. Hope certain european so called leaders will be sentenced for the crimes against humanity. Zelensky will be, for sure"
Russia invaded Ukraine and conquered Washington!
"what a surprise, looks like USA join Russia against Europe. There is no need for comments"
Lets hold all NATO countries accountable for aggression against Russia on the territory of Ukraine
Fall of Europe
They voted no multiple times for Israel being the aggressor and denied Israel’s committing a genocide so why shouldn’t they do the same for Russia?
"US did the right thing considering that the west brought this war on. They didnt invade anyone, but they caused the conditions that required an invasion by Russia of Ukraine."
UN is lopsided decision making body doesn’t take care of Gaza destruction done by Israel why? The war between Ukrainian and Russia started by who? and why? Ukraine wanted to be in NATO and forgot about the mink accord.
"Im trying to think calmly and rationally.Think about it....Although Trump is following the plans of Project 2025 for America, he changes his mind on other matters from one day to the next! If he sides with Russia, he will lose dozens of allies from different countries! Its not just those in the EU who support Ukraine! 🇬🇧🌍💜🕊️☮️🇺🇦🌻"
United States is BS.
Nation leaders need to stand up to Trump. He is causing so much turmoil cares only about America and aims at the downfall of so many nations. He needs to be stopped.
Russia and USA the same coin 2 faces
"U aint seen nothing yet people, u voted for a change, now you have got it"
When your greatest enemy supports you and you two develop a bro vibe..
History repeatinv itself? Makes Trump look like Chamberlin lol.
Taiwan look carefully what u want in future
ONLY TRUMP AND NOT THE AMERICANS SIDED WITH RUSSIA.
4 years of INSTABILITY from D. Trump and V. Putin! How can a permanent member of UN be removed? The UN Charter is clear. Any annexation of a State’s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the UN Charter and international law. This can be done when a member state has violated the principles of the United Nations Charter! UN should revoke the Kremlins permanent membership in UNSC!
Trump administration is out of mind! BY VOTING NO!
I was a Trump supporter but now Trump has gone mad. He seems to be controlled by Putin for some reason.
North Korea also has a lot of minerals. See you at the Pyongyang BBQ
Israel voted against Ukraines proposed resolution as well. Siding with Russia obviously. Surprised Al Jazeera being Al Jazeera failed to mention that.
UN Resolutions mean NOTHING. UN could NOT and did NOT stop ANY of the Wars since WW2.
Looks like putin played reverse uno card
whats going here
The Biden Administration is the instigator of this war
Trump was always a Russian puppet and a Putin asset. Americans are an extremely ignorant and foolish nation.
Somalia standing wit Ukraine
an embarrassing moment USA sided with Russia not voting UN resolution for Russia as the aggressor time for the allies to think twice.
Ukraine is too close to Moscow to join NATO! It is suicidal that its actor president doesnt know it!
"But its true, Ukraine started this...finally I agree with trump on somethings"
For the first time we have a more honest USA.They are honoust about invading motives unlike previoys administartions that suposudly invade to bring democracy.And now they are honoust about the US provoking the Russian invasion.
Never trust the U.S. it loves land grabbing war criminals like Putin and Netanyahu. Netanyahu killed more unarmed civilians than.
Why can they come together on Gaza for the two states?
"shame on you, Trump. this does not reflect America."
"&quotRussia is pleased with their lapdogs MAGA and their leader tRump, betraying Ukraine, Europe and destroying NATO.&quot"
Not in agreement with Trump on this one.....not sure what to make of this...
"US is not NATO, kick them out and welcome Ukraine to NATO."
UN is retarded. The west pushed Russia into the war and then claimed they invaded. What a joke. America wouldnt settle for China putting biolabs in Mexico. Same point.
"Wow cinema , two bitter adversary now two better friends even close than China, Iran once sanction is removed"
But it is ok for USA to illegally invade Iraq in 2003. Bunch of hypocrite US politicians
"Its official, Trump is for Putin. How many times does Trump have to side with Putin, against our allies and U.S. strategic interests, to understand that Trump is somehow compromised with Russia?"
America First Means America Alone
POLSKI RUSKI
"Even China or CCP was too embarrassed to vote against it ,they just abstained, its a huge shame for democritic US!"
Love Trump and Putin
America has become pathetic. Sad!
The war starts even before the fighting begins. This war was started in 2008 by NATO nations to corner Russia so it is not important who fired first shot.
"Wow, what a company for USA to be in. Ashamed but not ordinary American vote"
"Welcome to our dictatorship club, US! ))"
SHAME ON TRUMP
As an American I confirm the support for Russia.
"bro, we better get the artic circle after this."
"If America betrayed its allies, its a shame forever."
"You see Taiwan, America loves to flip flop and discard I mean put themselves first, as much as independence is great, your mainland neighbour unlike them would never leave or switch sides on you. Blood is thicker than water, and your market will be so much greater with them than being stuck in this limbo where neither China nor America will help you. Just look back 10 years ago to see how prosperous the economy was"
They started it and ending it......
I'm ashamed of my country. How horrible. No shame!!!
"umm I dont remember voting for her to vote on my behalf. I'm an American citizen I really don't care who though the first stone it should have never been thrown in the first place I think we all can agree it needs to stop. but I will say that in my investigation what does seem like Russian may have through the first stone unclear if Russians leader gave the order or just a rogue colonel or general. I just hope we can all find a middle ground for all of us to live healthy and happy on the planet we share ,we love you"
"Sad, this is not my country. I want my country back"
US need to go to the list off terrorist suporters
"The US Dems and the mainstream media that supports them have no credibility whatsoever anymore. Their own BS propaganda has caused that to them. President Trump did not blame Ukraine for starting the war with Russia, as CNN and multiple other media outlets have falsely claimed. That is also their BS propaganda against President Trump. He blamed President Biden`s and President Zelenskyy`s inability to prevent the war through negotiations with President Putin for that war. CNN and all the other media outlets know this perfectly well. The fact of the matter is that President Biden and his administration was only interested in negotiating with Russia about the JCPOA deal. And they decided to do that at the cost of Ukraine.President Biden was not even able to talk without a teleprompter anymore. And still the Dems leaders, the &quotmost&quot trusted CNN and multiple other news outlets promoted him for a second term. Those same dishonest idiots who promoted the badly senile Joe Biden for a second term see only negatives in President Trump compared to President Biden. Thats total madness in my opinion. EU`s imports of Russian fossil fuels in 2024 was worth EUR 21.9 billion and EUs financial aid to Ukraine in 2024 was worth EUR 18.7 billion. The EU used more money to purchase fossil fuels from Putins Russia in 2024 than they used on financial aid to Ukraine. How crazy is that! Hypocritical European leaders financed President Putin`s war against Ukraine with EUR 21.9 billion only in 2024. That is the amount of EURO`s they used to purchase fossil fuels from Russia. The Dems, CNN and multiple other media outlets see nothing positive in President Trump`s efforts to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine. But they saw nothing negative when President Biden did not even try to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine. How crazy is that? President Biden continued to negotiate with Russia about the JCPOA deal after their attack on Ukraine as if nothing had happened in Ukraine. And not a word about that at CNN, the &quotmost&quot trusted, or multiple other media outlets. President Biden`s priority was to get the US back to the flawed and outdated JCPOA deal, also known as the Iran-nuclear deal, no matter what. He did not care one bit about the protection of Ukraine. President Biden tried to appease Russian, Iranian and Chinese leaders so that they would let the US back to the outdated and flawed JCPOA deal. And he did that at the cost of Ukraine. Hard not to think that the US Dems, CNN, together with other big international media outlets and political parties that support the US Dems want that war between Russia and Ukraine to continue."
"1. The 27 EU states reformed into a Confederated Europe 🇪🇺 (United under Freedom, Stronger under Democracy !&quot) 2.

People dont understand. Its part of the deal that the US would refuse to name Russia as the aggressor. And also Russia knows well the US is behind the war and the bio labs in Ukraine. Deal.
"you all need to go back to the begining of the conflict and see who fired the first shot that started the war,when it was said russia is surrounding ukraine,when the old v tanks came under fire,not one shot was fired from any of them,for they did not have ammo"
"Because its true! yes Russia started the war! But you people! have to understand why they started it on the first place! and Yes its bcoz of Nato and Ukraine!Russia only condition is for Ukraine not to.join Nato as it expands their military towards their border and thatll put their security at stake! but what Nato and Ukraine did??? they provoke Russia and still do what they want. Lets put it this way. Its like a stranger building something on front of your house gate, thats what Nato and Ukraine are doing! would you feel safe if that happens to ur own house! if only Countries respec Russias bounderies, Ukraine war wouldnt happen!!!!!"
Russia dont be a fool this is all with a deep agenda and planning of Americans for the zaonist genosidal regime.
tiny hat meltdown
"Par dictat dorange, traiteur dAmerique! Honte!!!!!"
"3 yrs of Ukraine stealing American Tax payers Money, this War started 2014 Where are the France and UK and those House Help EU"
France and great Britain are cowards
Good! We have been provoking Russia since the early 90’s with further and further expansion. I get it. But let’s end the war.
I learnt UNITED NATIONS AS AN AMAZING BODY DURING SCHOOL DAYS. NOW I REALISE ITS JUST A JOKE.
"Learn your history. The UK and US launched a color revolution in 2014 to changed the elected government in Ukraine. That government began a 8 year murderous assault on the Russian speaking people of the Donbas. Finally after much patience the Russians invade. By the way that was after the West broke at least two agreements. NATO is the aggressor and will be disbanded. The EU is next. Europe is exposed for being the paper tiger they always were. When the US goes home, Europe has zero teeth. Prove me wrong with facts."
The word on the street is that the US President is a Russian asset.
Very symbolic. The three giants on the Security Council voted the same way. The two smaller &quotpowers&quot the other. Could it be any clearer how the new world order is looking?
"The whole of Europe has been abandoned, and Germany has become the biggest clown"
Awesome
3 years fight against 70 years Palestinian fight over their land.
"Shameful by Trump &amp US.We could rightly think of a potential civil uprising in Russia as years go by, and Russia people would understand. It has always been misinformation &amp propaganda who ruled the Rus population.Now we suddenly see a like-minded Trumps on behalf of US. Look at Russia &amp putin as kind of friend and all other nations as a kind of enemies.In Europe, we know Trumps are dangerous for world peace order.US now standing together with Russia, north Korea must be a gigantic chock, especially for those who vote on Trumps a second time. Despite all warnings.⚠️ I hope the &quotgreat US nation&quot some how, know when things are going in a very wrong direction.Could this lead US into some kind of civil uprising even before it happen in Russia?Or will US just accept a madman Trumps proposal to be friends with dictators in our fight for a free world."
Is that trump death and blind.
Trump have become realist due to his amazing team. US really wants peace and best of US. Aggressor is Ukraine and Zelneskyy. Thats the fact.
America wants to stop another war that they encouraged and supported firstly... Zelenskyy should have learned from history America is with you only if you win otherwise they only protect their investment and interests.
USA is an international embarrassment
Elect clowns expect a circus.
Oh boy…
Prob not a good idea to finger point when you’re trying to work out a peace deal.
"Europe is a joke, even Europeans know it"
Shame...
This headline is so historical I have to add it in my Engineering thesis
So it looks like the citizens of USA thought they voted for Trump but in reality they voted for Putin as President of the USA
What a disgrace!
US is double faced. EU needs to cut off relationship with America if
"Trump, Putin and Kim on the same side...."
"World should understand, America isnt your friend ,if you dont give minerals u r an enemy"
"A historical event: Russia, Noth Korea, and US in the same corner."
Trumps Usa Double Play ....?Zelenski Puppet ....Stand by
No alliance with the US is safe. All those countries whose strategic defense policy which has the US as its foundation partner has now been undermined. No wonder China is sniffing around Australia and New Zealand to re-enforce the point. The US is now a joke.
Palestine has been occupied for more than 75 years but Ukraine still support Israels ocucpation of West Bank
🇺🇸ican armed forces......humiliated again by the Trump administration
The United States of Russia.
"Kissinger : It may be dangerous to be America s enemy, but to be America s friends is fatal."
"The UN is a criminal organisation boing the work of the WEF, the Rockefella institute and the Bill and Malinda Gates institute."
Im absolutely loving this
"hahaha, where are those ?European losers now"
Day of Infamy 2.0.
US did what necessary to achieve meaningful peace. Smart move Mr Trump. Rest of NATO wants a long war without a clear achievable objective.
"So the UN who is supposed to be for peace, it trying to wreck a peace deal by mudslinging. How about let the peace talks commence, you know your primary function maintaining peace."
"If you search the Bible carefully,You might find that God gave Ukraine to Russia."
The correct to pronounce Ukraine is Russia.
"Finally, the US has started to wakeup to the fact and reality that we are in a multi polar world."
America officially under Trump and The Republicans join the Axis of Evil.
Trump knows who really started the Ukraine war.
"There's no need to cut anything in half. The Yankees will fool us anyway. President, don't fall for their sweet talk. They are our enemies."
"Ukrainians are annoying, always begging and extremely entitled."
"Putin is crazy but NATO ignored about a million warnings about taking in Ukraine. Kissinger and the US ambassador warned it would lead to war in 1994, Angela Merkel said the same 15 years ago and NATO secretary Jens Stoltenberg said Russia warned them months before attacking, this war was easily avoidable👍"
Infamy Day
"Russia, north korea, united States."
Has the US gone stark raving mad?
This time AMERICANS VOTE FOOL[TRUMP]
"Dont worry everyone, China moved right in to say...&quot see we told you so. America bad, China good &quot Lol Lmao"
"The world has gone off the deep end. The US openly on the same side as Russia, North Korea, Belarus."
The UN resolution should also say the invasion was not unprovoked. With all their smarts and statesmanship the EU + UK did nothing to placate the possibility of this war. As if they were waiting for Russia to invade so that they could say Russia started the war and they have the moral imperative to start a proxy war against a major nuclear power. They are abusing NATO section 5 to carry out their convoluted and deranged Russia game. No degree of carnage and destruction is appalling enough for them bc they have lived through two WWs. The best security for Europe is a neutral Ukraine and honest continuous effort to build mutual trust and cooperation with Russia.
"USA at last you are right , Russia is protector of humanity"
What’s the point of this resolution?
"This is a country (USA) that is well known for throwing countries under the bus....... ie. S. Korea, Vietnam , Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine and now? EUROPE."
It just shows that Putin have something on Trump and Elon. No wonder Trump folded so fast.
"Let Europa fix their own mess problem, why do some many countries afriad to fight Russia alone, but they keep saying Ukraine is winning the war, Europe is an America fialed lab test because the test object started acting like the short caller, cowards they didnt have the balls to vote against USA final resolution, they choose to abstain like cowards😅😅😅"
Disgraceful
Who cares about non binding UN resolutions. This is a total waste of time.
Americas education system is to blame. A bunch of dummies voted for a clown.
Nice
Ending every war!
LMAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAOOAAOA I CANT STOP LAUGHING THIS HAS ACTUALLY BECOME A CIRCUS
This channel is good luandry machine
Finally they have some guts to stands for the truth.
60 millions of Americans idiots voted for Tramp!!!!!
Thats all they know &quotVETO&quot traitors.
This is insane
"America is not an ally anymore, it is the enemy."
Russian Putin dont know English but know Russian Trump dont know Russian but know English if they join together Trump can learn Russian Putin can English and the outcome will be amazing 
Russia and the US wanting to slice up Ukraine. Just another transaction like the Gaza for Trump - the people- who cares!
No we didnt. America wants our money back.
"Trumps a dictator wannabe, hope the States goes down the drain"
It shows in politics there isno perminate enemy or friend .
As a US citizen I would like to apologize to the world for the path my country is taking.
The people of the 4 new oblasts made their choice. They had elections.
Why no one is stopping Gaza war?
So this is how he ends the war in 1 day.
"Five months ago, Al Jazeera asked the Chinese representative why they didnt take the lead in boycotting Russia. Now, what? ha ha"
"He, bye bye Ukraine minerals"
USA has new friends
Haha how time changes
"US start this war years back and know what they do,shame on you"
Macedonia voted on the side of USA and Russia
Thanks all 93 nations being supporting Ukrine
Us is a plain disgrace to the world and hypocrite
Thanks american muslim voters
Seems Trump was true to his election campaign at last this war will come to an end. Russia was totally side kicked without listening to their side and Ukraine madness for NATO has really caused world to stand at the door of World War.
"Donald Pumpkin and FSB agent Muskovitz should be behind bars, wearing a straitjacket."
Nobody in the western world will trust U.S. any anymore !
The US position on this is beyond shameful.
"Its not USA no more, but RussiAmerica now, the puppy of Putin...."
The USA would also need Russia support for Greenland
"UN is useless and meaningless to do anything , they have done nothing in three years to stop the senseless killing"
Finally us india china russia can agree
"Ukraine instigated this war, Ukraine is the aggressor"
USA and NORTH KOREA old orange man is making the world laugh once again!
I'm starting to doubt whether Trump really isnt a Russian agent infiltrated in the American government. How is all this fanaticism for Putin possible?
This is our turn to the dark side.
Nobody listens to the UN its just a joke
disgusting the USA should be ashamed ... they have lost the title of leaders of the free world
This is a very interesting time that we are witnessing…… ! I salute you from Mogadishu 🇸🇴
This is how US business works not the principle the team currently leads US has no clear pln
USA is in negotiations with Russia. They are not going to play he said she said. USA goal is to end it asap.
It’s funny that US is in charge over Europe as UK and France didn’t veto security council resolution!
UN is a useless organization.
"rUsSiA, now joined together."
"Trump makes America even taller, so it falls even lower."
Biden didnt vote against IsraelStop your propaganda at Al-Jazeera.
USA voted for the truth. NATO expansion triggered the Ukraine war.
Disgraceful! Please put me on record as to saying I did not vote for President Trump (Im a true American!)
"Ensuring the security of Europe is an end to biased paranoid Russophobic policy. It is necessary to understand the causes of the conflict in Ukraine, taking into account the fact of aggression of the Zelensky-Poroshenko Kyiv regime against the self-determined territories of Ukraine that did not want to be part of this regime after the overthrow of the constitutional order in Ukraine on February 22, 2014. Fanning of paranoid-schizophrenic Russophobia is leading the world to the third World War. stop There is only one way to end the war in Ukraine - to open the &quotDeclaration on the Principles of International Law&quot, which does not deny the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Ukraine to protect the self-determined republics. Let me remind you that self-determination of territories according to the UN Charter is a legal norm."
UN and USA are a sick joke.
Good initiation of peace
US does wtf it wants for its intrest
Shame on the US.
"I think people forget , the Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Half the money and weapons have probably disappeared.I just dont want to pay for the war and i want the refugees to go home."
"&quotBe united, O concourse of the sovereigns of the world, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled amongst you, and your peoples find rest. Should any one among you take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice.&quot -- Bahaullah"
At least they are not hypocrites now. as they were before when they sided with Ukraine and Israel
Pres Trump knows the truth about this war.
Finally Ukraine with Zelensky is kicked off the pedestal of victimhood. EU and Ukraine (politicians) started this conflict in 2014. Russia put its foot down in 2022 to say ‘no more’. It always takes two or more in a conflict.
Common sense has returned to USA !
In this US era were risking seriously that some sort of peace deal might lbe achieved with Russia and that cannot be allowed to happen.
"The president of U.S is disgusting, what has Putin got on trump."
"Trump and Kim are good buddies. Remember, during his first term, he met Kim at the border face to face"
I think theyre All after Ukrainians Rare Earth Minerals
Europe wants to destroy USA causing it to fight Russia and have economic struggle . They do everything to start the war . Not knowing it might cause more damage to Europe than USA
We dont consider UN important anymore because they fail in everything most of the world is embroiled in conflicts
"North Korea and Israel, two new bffs"
"Shame on USA ,appeasers"
Im sad to see this.
The US couldn´t have voted otherwise. Because the US has been the aggressor in lots of conflicts so in Ukraine too. Then they would have gotten the same stamp as well.
Ahahahaha. New NATO Alliance that will include dictatorial countries. Ahahahaha
Nothing is real at this point bruh
The aggression started in 2014 when the UAF attacked the eastern ethnic Russian population.
The UN and NATO need to invade Russia and remove Putin from office
Us votes along with countries ran by dictators
"Im so confused, why did Ukraine also vote against?"
United Nations is EU so it makes sense .....big powers dont care about UN...
The USA stands shoulder to shoulder with North Korea.
Bro ukraine even said no watch video
Where's the UN vote on the israeli occupation of Palestine for over half a century?
America... u good?
Why UN not give same vot against Israel
America is a joke
"Let’s go back to 2014, now try to explain yourself"
Ukraine won..russia is the aggresor as icj ruling... crimea belongs to crimea as unga resolutions and icj rulings..
Why didn’t UK and France use their veto power?
Please stop any war
United States is the worst ally you can imagine.
This is so crazy
US cancer of world peace
"America is 100% right, it’s slap on Europeans"
"US: Guys, stop."
"is it Geo politics ? or just GUN, MONEY and an IDENTITY ?? you power countries please save the mother earth and help the poor . develop the skill .. invest most of your resource please on humans .. civilised human can makes this world better . reward and punishment must work well on every corner."
The digital display : clearly shows that the US abstained and did not vote against the UN resolution alongside 72 other members.Unless this is for something else because even Ukraine abstained.
Canada/EU/UK must strengthen their military ties against the Axe Russia/USA/North Korea.
"Let me get this clear. Ukraine sent soldiers and tanks into Russia and attacked them? I think not. Bringing the war to an end is a good thing but what will the US administration do if Russia decides to invade Poland, for example? Blame the Poles?"
"So, who is going to be the leader of the free world now?"
The USA are traitors.
Al Jazeera is dead long time ago
US refuses to blame Russia for Ukraine war.
North Korea is part of the UN? thats news to me
Hypocrisy of USA.
this was the globalist every step of the way.
"Anyone who calls the invasion by Russia unprovoked is an a**hole. You have no respect or consideration for the concerns of others, so why should they respect yours?"
"And the US is right, cause you could also see NATO as the aggressor when it comes to expanding their influence eastwards over the years. Russia has always said that they didnt want this after the fall of the Soviet Union, but the west kept on pushing and thats also in my eyes a provocation. No NATO country at the Russian border period! Lets make Ukraine and the rest of the countries that fall between NATO and Russia neutral and use them as a border to keep the 2 superpowers away from each other. This way you avoid geopolitical and military tensions in the future"
"UK, France, why not vote no The glory belongs to Ukraine. We must regain our territory and don’t stop the war. 800 million Chinese people support you."
"USA-Russia-China new friendship, Europe is done"
America is biggest threat for peace
that is USA friendship for you
How many resolution condemning Russia has been passed by UN? Has it ended the war? Has any nation send their army to enforce these resolutions against Russia? How does this resolution end the war?Why is this resolution coming while Trump is trying to end the war? Is Europe holding up to continue having cheap Ukraine labour refugees? Is Europe not supporting Trumps plan because they wont be in charge of Ukraine reconstruction?Does Europe hope to have access to Ukrainian resources after the war but Trump has place a first one on them?
I am sure in next few days economic sanctions on Russia will be lifted. The same country that supported Ukraine a few years ago is now against it. I know the leadership has changed but what about the people of USA? Do they also think it’s Ukraine’s fault?
BRAVO LA RUSSIE---BRAVO LES ETATS-UNIS--ADIEU LES CARNIVORES DE MACRON!
dont feel jealous aljazeera
I didnt know north korea was in the UN
USA + RUSSIA IS BACK
"Now EU is truly in shock ,I do believe all these is for their own good so that they can finally get independence from the US &amp stop destroying their countries &amp their economies by following the US like sheeps into needless wars that has never been in their interest!"
The American VETO lady will be there scratching her head
This is useless UN security council...US dont follow the UN security council so why should other must follow. Rules must be same so if everyone follow UN security council then we must adopt every laws under UN...
"Yeah, others will do so"
Trump desires to seek the approval and favor of the biggest serial murderer on earth?SMH
NATO violated NATO enlarged agreement.
First time America voted on the right side they need to do same with Palestinians now and realise netanyahu is not Americas friend
frump is a dangerous idiot and pootins rent boy
free Palestine
US is the one that provoked Russia by surrounding the nation with its military bases. Ukraine was the last straw. US was the root aggressor.
"I am wondering does UE want to end the war in Ukraine? Calling Putin aggressor or war criminal, even if he is one, would make the war longer not shorter."
I am reading &amp hearing right. RIGHT?
United Circus
"How about palastini freedom of country , UN good sleeping pigs farms eat and drink sleep this full time"
"United Nations is a joke anyway, youd think if you have a whole organization where you have all of europe and every other country talk about illegal land grabbing / war aggression they would have maybe stopped it 3 years ago? These people do not care if Ukraine ceases to exist.. they could care less - its all about the money"
USSA! USSA! USSA!
What have the former resolutions of blaming Russia achieved?
! It was Never Russia at Fault. They Gave Many warnings to the USA and NATO not to Break their Agreement. But the UN is Such a SHAME! A FULL GENOCIDE in Palestine for all the World to See and the UN did NOTHING because it was their Baby Apartheid Colonial Israel and the USA!
Ukraine is a no country its over shut your mouth
Unfuckingbelievable
The ambassador does not want to lose her job by following her own heart and not carrying out Trumps order. Trump will never blame on Putin over starting the war. After all he had beaten Hilary Clinton with disinformation provided from Putin.
"Maybe as a business-oriented person, Trump sees more business opportunities with Russia than Europe. Europe depends so much on the US for many things, while Russia does not. It is yet another time for political realignment."
"Russia+China vs US+EU is not good for $, So, the Plan is US+EU+Russia."
China Abstained in the UN voting Xi Got the both World Russia n US k!
While the security council practicing double standards Palestinians lives are ingraved in their minds. This will go down in history
"As Trump said again n again, You can replace money or wealth but you cannot replace Precious Human Lives k!"
Stop with double standards as many innocent civilians lives are lost and you continue supplying weopons and bombs! A reminder when Truth and Reconciliation Commission is committed all will be complised in war crimes as no nation stood for peace! Only the voters stood for peace and voters demands were ignored. This will go down in history!
Chaos all over the world the future is interesting
"Donald Trump was recruited by the KGB in 1987 and given the codename &quotKrasnov&quot, claims a former Soviet intelligence officer.The bombshell allegation was made by Alnur Mussayev, a former Kazakh intelligence chief, in a Facebook post, reports the Mirror. The 71-year-old, who previously headed Kazakhstan’s National Security Committee, said he had served in the 6th Directorate of the KGB in Moscow, which was responsible for counter-intelligence support within the economy.One of the directorate’s primary objectives, he claimed, was “recruiting businessmen from capitalist countries.” According to Mussayev, Trump, then a 40-year-old New York real estate developer, was one of those recruits. &quotIn 1987, our directorate recruited Donald Trump under the pseudonym Krasnov,” he wrote.Mussayev’s post did not include evidence to support his claim, but in a further comment he made another shocking allegation. “Today, the personal file of resident ‘Krasnov’ has been removed from the FSB. It is being privately managed by one of Putin’s close associates,” he alleged. His allegations come amid years of speculation over Trump’s ties to Russia, dating back to his first visit to Moscow in 1987.At the time, Trump, then a rising star in the New York property market, travelled to the Soviet Union to explore the possibility of building a hotel in the capital. Soviet officials reportedly facilitated the trip, raising questions among intelligence analysts about whether it was a routine business opportunity or something more scandalous.Several years ago a report highlighted how, in 1985, the KGB had updated a secret personality questionnaire distributed among its officers, detailing how to identify and recruit Western figures. The document, according to intelligence sources, instructed agents to target “prominent figures in the West” with the aim of “drawing them into some form of collaboration with us… as an agent, or confidential or special or unofficial contact.”Mussayev’s claim appears to suggest that Trump may have been one such target. Despite years of scrutiny, Trump has vehemently denied having any improper ties to Russia or colluding with President Vladimir Putin.However, some US officials have repeatedly raised concerns about his close relationship with the Kremlin leader, particularly during his first term in office. Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as Trump’s White House communications director in 2017, added to the intrigue during a recent episode of The Rest Is Politics: US podcast.He suggested that Trump’s deference to Putin has puzzled many of his former senior officials. “I think there is a mysterious ‘hold’ on the president,” he said. Scaramucci did not elaborate on what that ‘hold’ might be but suggested that several former Trump administration officials, including H.R. McMaster, James Mattis, and John Kelly— had also struggled to understand Trump’s affinity for Putin. “I don’t know why it’s like this,” he said. “McMaster couldn’t figure it out, Mattis couldn’t figure it out, Kelly couldn’t figure it out.”"
"Hopes President Trump could be right but with a grain of salt, that Putin doesnt want war? But this con man Putin, a KGB spy chief should not be trusted without severed retaliatory guarantees because Putin reneged or tanked on the Budapest agreement that provided security guarantee to Ukraine in exchange to abandoned its nuclear war arsenal it was this agreement and commitment to peace in Europe by Putin that encouraged Europe to invest heavily in Russian oil and gas industry, thinking Russia was aligned with Europe and its market participation to become a major competitor or player on the global market as did the Chinese, making China an economic powerhouse to reckon with, rather than a military centric country which is reassuring for global peace Russia was given all of that opportunity to succeed economically including Europe willingness to be oil and gas dependent on Russia totally much to Europe own follies but Putin chose aggression against Ukraine, a peaceful neighbour instead...how can Putin be trusted that he wants peace and no more war anymore this time around? How can President Trump believe Putin so much as did President Clinton that Putin was to become a man of his words and peace...which word, which word we may ask again of Putin without countermeasures? Especially after what we saw in Hitler in history in Europe in the 1930s and 40s, after so many appeasement and concessions made by Europe short of war, the leopard Hitler still was undaunted did not change his ways fast forward came WWII, rest is history with an added superior nuclear advantage Putin has to dangle with on any given day or instance...this is where Europe is again today?"
Where did china vote
"what is the point of the un?? They dont get anything done, its just for show"
"Im so sorry to hear this. Im so sorry to all the men and women who have lost family members and loved ones to this act of aggression by pukin, that serpent, dictator and war criminal. And to all the American taxpayers who paid a steep price tag to help Ukraine and its people defend themselves against this unprovoked act of aggression by Russia. In their violation of previous agreements made between them. On behalf of all Americans who are admittedly opposed to this ceasefire resolution and the buddying up to pukin, please forgive this nation for electing a traitor to all our allies in the United Nations. I didnt vote for the mad man, dictator wanna be myself, never have and never will. But here we are. May God guide us, lead us and deliver us from this present darkness. In Jesus name I pray, Amen. ♾"
Trumps is doing MAGA . He is the peace man
how are votes going to get tanks off the battlefield
Seems Stelliers dossier was right about Trump and Putin 2013. Best investment ever...
so how was the un going to enforce tge resolution with the usa?
USA RUSSIA NORT KOREA ....WHERE THEY PUT CHINA
Why would Russia withdraw from Ukraine territory they fought and died to get
This putting Putin in a lot of pressure
European countrys better look deeply oen problem.
"Who is aggressor, its Europe, dont want Peace. Dont want election in Ukraine. Its not Europe or UK business. Theyre can be in Peace meeting but not have any right to make any decisions for Ukraine or Russia."
Its 3 years of Russian defensive aggression against NATOs expensionist ambition! So the real aggressor is NATO!
"USA 🇺🇸 You are the cause of this war now all of the sudden you are a savior hypocrisy ,oh really now"
The US voted with Russia and North Korea
USA must learn from AI about definition of dictator
"When US-Russia-China agree on something, you know that is unprecedented. GG Ukraine/EU the war is over"
"At the 22 sec mark, it shows both Ukraine and US voting abstain. 93 in favor, 8 against, 73 abstain. Why would Ukraine abstain? And US did not vote against as the title suggests."
Hahahahaha..... USA voted for a resolution they wrote!
Lmao this is too crazy.
my god...amazing... its just amazing how this world functions..for 3 years BIDEN did NOTHING to stop the war.. forced the UK into following its lead...for 1 year did NOTHING to stop ISRAEL and forced the UK to follow suit..NOW.. TRUMP is siding with RUSSIA.. LOL LOL LOL look at the face on that British woman who has sat there for 3 years giving cover to UKRAINE to ISRAEL..now sitting there like a fool...
"For better or worse, a new world order has begun."
I more trust rusian ... Fact on data..
"Russia lost more soldiers then Ukrain , were do you get you numbers , such BS .."
Your numbers are wrong
Stop your Zionist propaganda
"where did you get this casualties and dead information ? you have to investigate then broadcast the news, Ukraine has lost more then half million soldiers and one million dead"
Its ukrein whos lost more soldiers
42k killed after 3 years ?! nice joke
data from satellite
It is very hard to find a media without bias and fakness
aljazeera a western wannabe propaganda machine.
"AL-Jazeera doesnt care about Ukraine, AL-JAZEERA always BACKS PUTIN AND COMMUNISM PLUS TERRORISTS throughout the world. A QATAR SICKNESS of HATE!"
After watching this analysis I m sure that al jazeera also a property of Zionist media
"Ukraine not armway to Russia , when they are not Nato member ."
Fake News
Why is aljazeera spreading pro us and pro Ukrainian propoganda
Russia is losing hahah
"I’m confused still with how Ukraine had 1.5 million soldiers and only 45k but at same they have run out of men to the point they’re kidnapping Ukrainians in the streets all over the country cause they run out of men. So how do you run out of men but only lost 45k? Is it Ukraine,nato, Al Jazeera,cnn, bbc,wion,Dw is it all these news outlets and organizations just not good at math or common sense or they just insulting the world calling us stupid?"
"Finally USA u r on the right side. Russia is so much necessary for our world to fight against wokeism. Good work ,Actually Russia own 25% now."
"The stats have always changed that much, it’s fair to say the media don’t know what they’re on about. What real stats are is anyone’s guess."
"So with only 45,000 death why is Ukraine still complaining about manpower shortage?"
I m unsubscribing for this false propaganda
Simple solution No NATO expansion
172k Russian soldiers killed ?? comon Aljazeera how do you know? in another words you are following a typical western propaganda
0 ukrain soldier died not 45000
You know how to laying very well
"Byabongobongo ibyo,, you are one side of the news,,,,, Russia ekosepelisa bino, aljazeera"
Aljazeera is master of spreading propaganda
"russia &amp israel fck up their country, totally bankrupt"
false. one million ukranian soldiers were killed. There are times Ukraine was losing 1000 soldiers a day.
"those numbers scream Ukrainian propaganda , you take us for fools? lol"
NATO expansion caused this war
AL-Jazeera should be ashamed with this hypocrite presenter and his false narrative.
"I guess you cant do both tell the truth about Palestinian and tell the truth in Ukraine, that would be suicide on social media.You gotta pick one or the other, otherwise say goodbye to your licence in a lot of big markets"
Putin started the war first.
"50 years for Russia and 100 years for Ukraine, sacrificing the youth for nothing."
Bias reporting
"45000-17200 is 1-3.82, If this is true, then the flag of Ukraine has already been planted in Moscow"
"Really the war doesnt worth losing 2,7 trillions Dollars globally, just a suicide decision to continue the war ,most of the Ukraians outside want and willing to return back home while they love life and culture of their country dearly"
500 billion to rebuilt russia is the one who is taking destroyed settlements
Al Jazeera has always been Russophobic.
"I thought Aljazeera had integrity! Ukeraine has lost close to Million soldiers so far, not 23000! Please dont stoop low to the levels of CNN or BBC. The events of last 2 weeks shows what lying about conflicts can do to the credibility of news channels!"
"2022 Putin: &quotUkraine is inalienable part of Russia!&quot 3years invasion: womp womp. 2025 Putin: We just need Ukraine to stay out of Nato.Looks like Al-Js Russia stats really triggered a bunch of Putinst, lol."
"I was not expecting such bullshit from Al Jazeera , I am unsubscribing this propaganda chanel"
"This is a war of genocide of people in Ukraine, by the Russian army. And judging by the actions of Trump, who is humorously called &quotEbanko&quot, the US is in cahoots with the Russians, and maybe even the &quotCustomer&quot of this genocide. Trump needs Ukraines mineral resources: uranium, nickel, manganese, lithium (hello to Musk, Trumps financier), and shale oil."
"This man is on drugs, Russian has lost 3 times more soldiers but ukrain is losing and facing shortage of soldiers.This is a propaganda that makes you looks stupid"
"Ukraine only lost 45,000 what BS is this LOL .... these stats are garbage"
Lies! Propaganda! Its western MSM for you. Russia advancing and your percentage shrinks
Stop lying of the work don’t worry about Russia
The stats are wrong!
False narratives
Biast report
What the heck was this? Some propaganda for Pro Ukraine supporters?
Bullshit
"Territories belong to Russia, resources belong to US, debts belong to EU, sufferings belong to Ukrainians, glories belong to Zelensky"
Narrative Vs Reality
Dumb man spewing out nonsense
"This is what Neta. nyahu wants to exploit, to have support for him alone, and why not, it is free and.."
"This is even confirmed by Ukraine !! The Russians fire the cannon 10 times, and the Ukrainians once !! and FABS, DAB 3000 and ODABS aerial bombs !! The Russians are entering Ukrainian territories once they KILL ALL UKRAINIANS !! And yet the Russians CAN WITHDRAW AND THE UKRAINIANS DO NOT !!"
Pure propaganda
"Where do you get your statistics ?? The Ukrainian MOD ?? Only 45,000 killed, yet the Russians outnumber them by anywhere from 5 to 1 to 10 to 1. The Russians have air support, the artillery rate of fire is also anywhere from 5 to 1 to 10 to 1 also in favour of the Russians. It just isnt possible. Typical Western propaganda."
"God bless Russian, Glory to Russian in Jesus mighty name amen, Salaam alaikum, wa alaikum salaam,"
False Narrative
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris,Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,,"
Ukraine should surrender and prevent further loss of life and property.
Get a smooth translator this one is good but one has to work at listening.
What ever u doPutin dont board any plane safety
There is a whole special military operation happening on the background
Dont think about language it is dictations of Biharis.
"Putin is time to quit, give to the people free elections. Youre corrupted ad Trump is, and out of your mind!"
Couldnt understand the translator
Old dog
President Trump cares about life
"The power of the Holy Spirit الله is with President Trump, who is saving the World from future Dictator Zielinski. (Ref: Bible: Luke 24:49)"
"By aligning itself entirely with the US-led NATO strategy against Moscow, Germany has unwittingly sealed its economic fate. The consequences are already visible, and the worst is yet to come. Germany is doomed because of this grave mistake"
It’s sad when Al Jazeera is the mostUnbiased news source lol
You and your American spoofer friend are well matched
"I wouldnt trust putin or trump as far as I could throw them. Liars, criminals and conmen."
"I respect putin. I dint like him,but I dont know him. He is not a fool , he is expert at ju jitzu. He cares about his country. Russia has every right to defend itself."
Zelensky is the dumbest president in history. He believed the British and Americans that they would give him enough weapons to go to war with Russia. In 3 years he lost 15-20% of the countrys territories and hundreds of thousands of people. Another 7 million Ukrainians left the country. Eventually he will be forced to sign a surrender. The stupidest president in history. He will be judged by his own people if he does not manage to go to London.
Putin should Not Trust Trump. Trump is a liar and a snake
War criminial has sent his people to be butchered and has recked the lives of the countless Ukrainians
Yea y poo ur troops are advancing backwards
Why would you believe putin or FELON47 ?
"Russia is a dying animal. As soon as Putins number is up, it will be total anarchy over there."
Trump takes gaza Putin takes ukraine Fare and square
"NATO is now European, Trump is afraid of Putin. What does Saudi Arabia have to do with this? nothing but love for murderous dictators. Scary time for Democracy’s around the world "
"Why does any idiot think a Country would have an election in the middle of a war? America didnt, thats why Roosevelt served so long. And Im pretty sure Trumps planning one if Congress wont approve a third term."
Final Victory Ukraine wait and see
Technically Trump told everyone Ukraine would be at the seat.
"President Trump believed President Putins side of the war and Zylensky must simply give up without US support, but war must End"
"Ukraine is more populated than Russia, more wealthy and more educated. Russia has got peoples and territories under their power that are not Russian. All this 16th Century Empire will explode and will leave the poor little Russia alone. The ethnic Russians are only 60 Million. The Siberians, Ouzbecks, Tarars. are 85 Million. The oil and gas is all in Siberia, Kazan, Oural, all NON RUSSIAN places who want to be independant. Ukraine had created Moscow in the 14 th Century to resist to Mongols. Staline had starved 20 million Ukrainians to decrease their population and power. Ukraine was not prepared for the invasion, but is capable of self-defense."
Israel is always insisting in people land because they have been backed by the US
"THE WORLD REVOLVES UNDER VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA"
India got a good relation with Russia so as China... Trump knows and made a good decision so far as they cant keep supplying arms... Make peace
"For the first time in modern human history a Muslim country is holding peace talks between two non-Muslim countries. AlhamdullilahBecause Allah has choosen His house(Kaaba) on their land and bestowed them with monarchy and power and Allahs last messenger,Prophet Muhammad(P.B.U.H) is buried on the same land. Coincidence after another Coincidence. And yet people doubt about miracles of Islam."
"Just because KSA is spearheading peace talks between the USA and Russia 🇷🇺 Aljazeera does not need to get jealous. After all, we had Doha talks that brought peace between the Afghan government and the USA.Honest journalism is when anyone is mediating peace talks between any two countries. In this case, two giant nations. Everybody should feel happy and relieved that at least we are heading in the right direction. Qatar played its role in Israeli hostage release, and Qatar hosted FIFA, and Qatar caught Indian spies and put them in jail. So Qatar has been dominating the world scene besides being known for their rich snob behaviour"
Putin is trumps idol
If you feel worthless.. Watch Wester media since the beginning of the war..
"Long live president putin Long live president Trump, we need peace"
Why this translator again and again? Such an inconvinient voice to hear
Free weezy
Zelenskyy is a snitch jew like a mouse
Pre Putin
I dont understand which English he speaks?
I understand Russia and have watched this from RT. Aljazeera translator should be sacked well i dont even blame the translator he must also be a propagandist becauase some of the word the translated was very wrong and i know it was delibrate
If Putin says that then it is true. he doesnt bluff
"Why don’t they use AI for these translations? Instead of imperfect, slow and flu-affected humans?"
Putin is war criminal thug
Werid fact I never heard any english media outlet ever interview a Russian to find out how people are living in Russia or how do people really feel about Putin. LIKE NEVER
Dont forget Russia kicked out Hitler who Bossed whole of Europe . U wake up every morning and raise your hands in thanks while doing rituals
"World Historical Figure and Statesman, President Putin"
Ukraine has one last chancenis to tell France and Germany to help them fight Russia If not Ukraine should take the lost of all of that land lost and make peace.
This man sins the president of rusia millions were killed innocent lose my god
Donald Vonshitzinpants is a disgusting vile vindictive little man. Putin plays him like a violin...Zelenski got more class in his pinky the trump has in his obese orange body...when tump had a chance to serve he claimed Bone Spurs...hes a coward with zero class and less impulse control than a two year old.
"Trump knows Ukraine can’t win the war and Russia is right now are winning in the front lines, so obviously stopping the war is the next best logical step."
"Biased news channel,how can we trust this network"
"Lol, it calls google earth. Old man be living in stone age"
Is trump an American President or a Russian ambassador I can’t tell
Someone is lying here
Both cowards the united state people will never be with Russian government
They love each other
Trump and Putin are boyfriends
"ZELESKY BEHAVIOUR LIKE A SPOILT BIY WHOS TESTING WITH BRITAIN KIER. WHY DOES GREAT BRITAIN BECOME A PUSH OVER , ITS TIME GREAT BRITAIN STEPS BACK TO BUILD BETTER IN UK WHILE PEACEFUL PEACE TALKS CAN COMMENCE WITHOUT ZELESKY THROWING A TANTRUM FOR MORE MORE PEACEFUL PEACE IS SUCCESSFUL WINNING WORLD 🌎 BEATIFUL PLACE NO MORE WASTON SPACE PROJECTS MAKE EVERY COUNTRY GREAT"
"Putin is a amazing leader, Wise wants peaceful times peace world ,Therefore its time Zelesky respect Wise leaders and request talks"
Hope Taiwan is taking note on the Ukrainians situations and not get herself in the same mess..
We’re the meetings about peace or a strategy to reverse the narrative?
Your old Criminal
Can someone tell me what the young lady is writing so fast? She’s part of the job.
"There is only one way to end the war in Ukraine - to open the &quotDeclaration on the Principles of International Law&quot, which does not deny the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Ukraine to protect the self-determined republics. Let me remind you that self-determination of territories according to the UN Charter is a legal norm. In order to end the war, we need to open our eyes to the unconstitutionality of the processes of governing Ukraine, to the illegality of the election of Zelensky and Poroshenko (bypassing the laws of Ukraine). Publicize the coup détat in Ukraine, which has been silenced since February 22, 2014, and publicize that the Constitution of Ukraine has been deactivated by the usurpers of power. Recognize that there is a war going on in Ukraine for the self-determination of territories that do not want to be part of the Zelenskyi-Poroshenko regime. Truth and justice must end the war in Ukraine, and the criminal leaders of the Kyiv regime must bear criminal responsibility. Why the truth is silenced, the answer is simple. western &quotdemocracies&quot need to impose loans on Ukrainians, and Russia needs to improve its army on the &quotUkraine&quot training ground using the enemy as a sparring partner, for Russia the army of the empire is above all else. ((( ? ))) On February 22, 2014, the president was removed in Ukraine, bypassing the Constitution of Ukraine, so why cant elections be held now, bypassing the same Constitution?"
"Great Leader Of Course Other countries they look different ways. he is good for his country ,he did good Job his country He developed lots of great achievements. World should respect him.IF Other countries Going Against Him ,He has a ability to Destroy the World , We Only Pray to God Better Future Better place and peace to the world"
Mr President salute
Good lord it amazes me how he babbles so much to hide his intentions or avoid answering a question.
Surrender to ICC. Its over!
The translator is depressing I couldn’t finish 10 minutes video
Who is this interpreter? WTF
"The killing has gone on way too long! Time for it to stop and concessions made, or Ukraine will ultimately be so crippled that they will be unable to go on. No food production, shipping ports, electricity, fuel ... you name it, all vary vulnerable assets.Everyone is running out of soldiers. Next, the big weapons will have to come out, and EU countries will have to deploy soldiers on the ground that will die. Do you think the EU is going to make the Ukraine part of the EU? Then send 500,000 soldiers and 75% of their GDP to fund the war? No, the remaining countrymen would revolt !! End it"
Ukraine
PUTIN HAS ORDERERED THE MURDER OF CIVIL POPULATIONS IN UKRAINE
PUTIN IS RESPONSIBLE OF WAR CRIMES
PUTIN IS A WAR CRIMINAL
PUTIN IS A MASS MURDERER
PUTIN IS CORRUPT
The best interpretors are in the comments. apply for the job pls.
I wonder how much this has to do with Russia and the growth of BRICS and move towards de-dollarization?
Bull lies more lies
"In short, we've almost stopped supplying gas to your mighty Europe. You've been having crisis after crisis there. It proves once again that you can only suck up resources and colonize the weak. We need to shut you off completely so you'll finally wake up..The balance of power has shifted. One country that you've been pressuring throughout history and not allowing time to develop is now fairly setting the record straight. Why did you cut us off from Swift? And you yourselves lost money. All your sanctions are being implemented through neighboring countries.You've put a spoke in your own wheel, and now, like Ukraine, you're screaming that the Russians are to blame for everything. Are you really that stupid? What can you do against Russia? At the very beginning, you were hoping for only one thing: that the whole world would block Russia."
I am very happy Putin and Comrade Trump agreed that Ukraine should have a voice in this. Trump making the Soviet Union great again.
Geppetto correcting his orange Pinocchio…
two Gangsters
I feel very sorry for the Ukrainian people .From the start I already suspected this would happen .Stupid leaders have fallen into the US debt trap
Putin rocks
This Hostess Is HOT . GOTDAYUUUUUUUUUMMM .I'LL CHANGE CAREER PATHS FOR THIS WOMAN
"Trump is a spokesman for Kremlin. Ok so whats the bet. 1) Putin has dirt on Trump. 2)Putin has promised Trump, that if he gives him Ukraine, Trump has first dibs on Ukraine resources."
Two of some of the worst leaders ever known down through history…is now calling the shots in modern times! Cold blooded men…
Is it the translator or my hennessy doing the job for me?
"Look at how Russia was condemned, even their news channels got banned in the uk!! Meanwhile zelenski is raking in the dollars purchasing properties all around the world!"
The translator is on Russian vodka
Insanity!! The translation is NOTHING what Putin is actually saying..
"Viva The most level headed leader in the 21st century. Like him, or hate him but you cannot ignore his presence in the world politics."
Who is afraid Putin from trump or trump from Putin
🇺🇸 Munich agreement of 1938 for 🇺🇦 will be tragic for whole 🇺🇦🇪🇺
God bless Vladimir Putin
Putin confirms the many fake news that many American YouTuber made.
"Oh my, Dumbass Putin is lying like a Felon Trump."
Translator sucks
Eu should step up and fight with Ukraine. Stop all USA influence in Europe. Europe is for Europe. Not Putins or Trump.
"Drunk or not, he sure has some glorious voice"
Zelenski needs to talk with Putin. This war needs to END. PERIOD. Zelenski can not win and America is sick of paying for this. Zelenski owns MILLION OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PROPERTY IN MIAMI.....Trump needs to seize it as payment to America. He vacations in Miami while His Country dies.
"This is how everything is set up to end. Putin retreats from Ukraine, Crimea remains autonomous but not part of Russia. US and NATO give assurance that Ukraine will never join NATO. Ukraine withdraws from Russia"
The problem with negotiatins is that the EU will not return to business as usual. Even if the war stops the decline continues due to no EU sanction relief. It will take a decade of almost free fossil fuels to get trade to halfway where it was.
"He is right, Ukraine can not defend itself without the west."
Translator is exhausting
Finally putin show the power If a country didnt have strong army and nuclear weapons dont do wars for others in own lands just do smart decisions USA left Ukraine on a half way
Scumbag
Genecidal war criminal. Where are the Ukrainian children?
I dont trust that al jazeera posted this
Down here in California homeboy we don’t care about Zelensky. I like Russia get off our back. Donald Trump is running the country and Donald Trump is running the world that spring Russia with 5000 nuclear weapons on our side. it’s like a dirty little pimp. Zelensky is a dirty little pimp. He’s got no money. He’s got no weapons and he mooches off our time.
Putin invaded Ukraine
"I accuse Biden, Nuland, France, Germany and Ukraine of lying about the Minsk agreements, one-two, so stop crying, EU"
"I support Peace and Freedom, peace for all"
zelensky fukedup Ukraine
Aljazeera you need a better English translator as Putin is a very important person and we need to understand whats hes saying exactly
Who gets the 30 pieces!
"2 dictators, poutine and felon to meet on how to destroy the world."
Trump lies about everything
Putin must listen to Almighty If not there is no way out
Translation is terrible. This is why they never understand Putin in the West
Trump is an absolutely ludicrous imbecile. Now a traitor.
PUTIN IS SO HAPPY LOL....SEE HIS FACE.....HE HAS GROWN 10 YEARS YOUNGER......ZELENSKY LOOKS SO OLD....
"So Zelinski talking about him not accepting peace, talks without him, just shows his insecurities and ignorance. This is literally how negotiating works.And with all the money, Ukraine has taken from America they don’t have a choice, but to do what they’re told"
"Translator , it’s like a lot of marijuana loaded"
Why does the caption say Israels war? Israel didnt start this war. Maybe all jazeera the can fool their Muslim viewers that are oppressed with no access to unfiltered information but we all know that this is a war started by Hamas terrorists and Israel will not back down. And most importantly the USA will back Israel at all cost!!!
Molotov and Ribbentrop. Putin and Trump.
"WAR CRIMINAL and a CONVICTED FELON, carving up The Ukraine, ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!!"
"If Drumpf , speaks, he lies."
None of what this idiot says makes sense... completely unconnected gibberish.
"Translation is not accurate like they putting their own words like he sayin it, wtf"
Worst translater ever
Interpreter had a rough night drinking cuba libre shots..
"Objective is peace. Objective is to avoid escalation. True objective is to avoid World War 3. For all of the dipshits critical of Trump, seeing that you have yet to catch up to history on Ukraine, the coup, Russian talks with Reagan to halt NATO … Trump is set to reverse 40 years of betrayal and corruption. Заткнись, дай переговорам шанс."
Is the translation intentionally this way to make the audience perceive Putin in a certain way?
"Aljeera haves more honest news then our fake news,they will never show this and if they did theynwill say Trump made Putin say this"
Just think of all the lithium Russian and American can share from Ukraine soil
"Also, Drumpf thinks Pol@nd started W W 2!"
Are Russians not Europeans??
Iddiot puttin. In vading UKarineGOD protect u
10 dollar cashapp thsy zelensky wont be there
Stupid diktator Vladolf Putler Putin will fall soon together with the russian imperium.
ZELANSKY IS totally failure in managing Ukraine affairs.War is no solution for Ukraine. TRUMP OFFER MUST BE ACCEPTED.
"Close transaction, but still important remarks are are omitted"
"This will probably be the time when Ukraine will target Putin and his plane to prevent the negotiations and to have Russia put the blame on Donald Trump, who has a known history of killing leaders. Careful there!"
Trump: Putins useful fool.
who is this autistic person translating
Storytelling putin
This amicable settlement between Russia and Ukraine is good lesson for EU and UK which have been inducing the war dand decoyed Ukraine for their self interests with purpose.
Trump betrayed Europe..... The damage did is maybe very hard to repair
FDJT and f putler. Cheers from Canada 🇨🇦
Put down the alcohol translator sound drunker then me
The worlds smallest gangster.
Europe needs to come up with a plan as soon as possible. They cannot just hope to keep the war going year after year.
How do you know when trump is telling a lie ? (Answer) If trump is speaking he is lying
Rus bots are on overtime with the comments and the vodka.
"A world full of good people and look at these 3 on the world stage. Putin, trump and Prince Bonesaw."
The world pays cause this dictator hates nato.
"Putin war inter 3 years but still on going war does not achieve the aim of that war uless lost many people , specialy Russian and ukriane people"
"All he has to do is say some nice things about trump, bought and sold..."
"Trump, &quotWhat is it you want Vladimir?&quotPutin, &quotI want all of Ukraine.&quotTrump, &quotIll see what I can do.&quotPutin, &quotYoull do what I want you to do. Remember, I own you.&quotTrump, &quotYes, you do, comrade. You certainly do.&quot😊😅"
Putin says Trump says. Two of the most prolific liars on the world stage. Two sociopathic murderers.
"For any one with intelligence and is informed Putin is completely full of BS. This has become a hobby for him, he wants to see how far he can getwith the west and what he can get away with. And with no regard for how many lives are lost or destroyed."
I want to visit Odessa soon!! Peace and Unity!!!!
So what the translator is a functional alcohlic and he is doing it right
Putin now talks better than Trump. This is ridiculous
Two leader meet and find out the solution for mankind and peace.
Americans asking Zelensky why bomb chernobil nuklear plant.puting the whole europe in danger of radiation
hahahahah putin is blaming trump and trump will take it like a good little bottom... putin owns that old fat orange traitor.
West playing a double game.
3 days to kiev! - Putin3 years later...Trump help me!- putin
Ukraine will be included to be informed of Putin’s decision
"The mass murderer, Putin must stop his war."
Trump make America great again.
Translation is pretty bad
"to america DEMILITARIZATION has no peace talks in there,those subsidy was offered and rejected by zelenskyy numerous times"
Please get a new translator... that was a tough listen.
Putin has Trump dirt stuff he can share public
america doesnt realize what the order means
Putin says trump told him.Are you joking or what?That crazy mad guy is a danger in plain sight.
"It may be related to the translation, but Putin‘s remarks made no sense."
america believes putin doesnt know what DEMILITARIZATION IS
Translator is terrible
"I thought the same that the translator is completely drunk, but he is always like that about Hamas as well"
"Putin acting like a innocent baby, after killing many. What is he expecting. Another land grab? Crazy mad fellow."
nice
Worst translator ever smh
Dictator Volodymyr Zelensky should stop this unjust war
He looks so giddy
translation sucks
Zelenskyy is a criminal and a Dictator
"You can not trust Trump or Putin, when anyone of those 2 says anything its 99% of the time a lie!"
WAltUHHh we gotta take Kiev....Waltuh...
This not putin..its another double
"Stop listening to russia! Help Ukraine WIN not SURRENDER! With all due respect to President, an election in Ukraine during war is not a solution, and it is not Constitutional. Victory first, punishment for the terrorist Putin, then election. Not otherwise. Trump is surrounded by far right russia-sympathizers, who are in love with Putin/China/North Korea/Iran. You do not reward Hamal leaders, why would you &quotnegotiate&quot with Putin????? Where is the &quotpeace through strength&quot? Reagan is tossing in his grave. Trumps numbers are also very wrong! No 4% approve rating. No matter what Biden said, Ukraine received only up to 70B NOT 350. No millions of people died in this war. WWII was was not by russia along 30% of the army consisted on Ukrainians! Russian tanks burn very well on the Ukrainian fields with the work of Ukrainian drones. Amen to that!"
Weird that they got Nosferatu to translate.
Ukraine don’t agree to anything from this liar.. Europe will help you.. Russia is unstable in economy and just see it through until they collapse 🇺🇦🇺🇦
Long live the Russian people!
Putin is shamed he total depend on Iran and North Korean and Wayners army and weaponry
"Ukraine will be part of the piece talks once a deal is made and once a new leader in ukraine is elected, Zelensky made it into law , it was a law stating that they cannot negotiate an end to the war with Russia or talk with Russian officials, So only America has the power to come to an agreement for ukraine"
Saudis should treat Putin the same way they treated Jamāl Aḥmad Khāshqujī.
It was nice having Aljazeeras translator decode what the original translator said.
"No ,needfor zelensky aa a mediator between usa and Russia talks in Riyadh.he is out of place same as EU and Nato.they just muddle the negotiation."
Putin should be old enough to have sense.When has Colonialism ever worked out Peaceful?? Never.It continues on for Generation after Generation until it is reversed. Silly waste of time and life.
Good work Trump and Putin
TRUMP PIG TRAITOR!
"Great and able leaders are from Russian and China. No interference, no internal chaos. No racist. Decent and responsible delivery as a great statesman."
"Putin has conducted this war Very Well, Congratulations God Bless RussiaGod Bless Ukraine"
Trump knows Putin is going to win in Ukraine. He is smart to side with a winner.
Too much talk. You invaded Ukraine period!!. Cede some parts back to them and stop this madness.
Putin is liar.. dont trust him
Who found this translator
Putin like lies
Why i dont understand. Help me here . Who started this War??
So sad that Donald Hitler and Vlad Stalin will decide the future of Ukraine
The translator doesnt sound drunk... He sounds like English isnt his primary language. Bigots
What did EU and Biden do to end the war? Nothing
Please get a translator that dont drink
Most reliable news platform
Dont negotiate with terrorists.
"Will gaza is the part of talks in saudia, russia x ukraine"
"When a liar is elected president of Ukraine, Ukraine will be invited"
and thank you aljazeera for not adding any palestine-israel conflict/war angle in this news video !
"1) US and Russia are restoring diplomatic ties2) Ukraine cant join NATO 3) the west must release the frozen Russian sovereign fund4) EU must refund the interest (from Russia sovereign fund)channel to Ukraine war.5) Trump will sign a security agreement with Putin.6) Why talk in Saudi? Its a conspiracy Saudi, US and Russia have agreed to fix the oil prices at will.7) Zelensky is running out of time as Trump force election before June 20258) the comedian conceded territories and mortgage rare earth and land resources"
the translator sounds like a drunk Mike from Breaking Bad lol
The translator is drunk
"this must be extremely confusing for Mr Putin and Russia, suddenly they are getting everything they wanted the way they wanted and USA President is talking on their points. I hope they recover from this shock"
"Thats not even Putin, look at him!"
Visibly aged
I pray for peace for Russia and Ukraine. May God bless both countries.
Whats up with the translator?
Thanks to The Honourable Crown Prince of Royal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Muhammad Bin Salman for making the great solution.
We do not need to be establishing relationships with a mafia state. It is.Insane to negotiate with Russia.There is nothing to renegotiate over.Nothing in ukraine belongs to russia.
What a brilliant leader
putin must be seen by psychiatric professionals
"Unbelievable. Talking about peace, and at the same time a massive drone attack on Odessa. Putting innocent civilians in the winter cold. No merci for the Ukrainians and lying all the time."
"My second wife (Oxana) was Russian. As far as I am concerned, President Putin is family. End the foolishness."
There wont be cos theyre keep on attacking Lebanon palestine Afghanistan
Aljazeera your translator SUCKS
Putin plays trump like a fiddle and trump is too dumb to figure it out
What kind of translator is this guy ?
Good defeats evil. The evil west as been defeated! Long live Putin!
Giving Putin what he wants will only make him want more and eastern Europe will be next
UKRAIN BECOME RUSSIA
Hopeless translation.
Zelenskyy is a terrorist he create Isis k to attack Russia he’s Zains he mad a lot money from this war he fight for money nat for his people are his country
"Instead of arming Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan US tax payer money should be spent on infrastructure, healthcare, education, homelessness etc."
"Russia and the United States and China will become allies.....The way of Allah is not the Way of mankind. It will all make sense in the end.... Assalamualaikum strong man Putin of mother Russia. Allah, the creator of the universe, our father, as in mine and yours is sending greetings and salutations to you and the great armed forces of mother Russia. The war in Ukraine, is your victory, take it and work along with His Excellency President Donald J Trump of the greatest country to ever walked on mother earth. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤➕➕➕➕➕➕➕🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺"
King of kings Putin
Europe is in Trump pocket and Arab is in Israel pocket and Israel is in Trump pocket and Trump is in putin pocket
The translator sound drunk.
Was the translator drunk?
Putin is all over the place – there is zero coherence to what he is trying to say.
Many thanks to Russia for fighting western imperialism
not West it is USA who is still providing weapons and information where to hit to Ukrainians to kill Russians and USA and Russia talk is drama where they not even discussed a single issue related to be solved to even start talking about stopping war. True representatives of Ukraine and Europe cannot be part of the talk because they will ask questions which will blow the Russia and USA talk drama.
"I NO PUTIN YOU AND TRUMP NO WHAT YOUR DOING, TWO BIG LEADERS??YOU BOTH ARE NOT STUPPID??"

"Amazing stuff, did you know that Trump and Musk have a store on Payhip and its called Trump&ampMusk"
I hope there will be peace as soon as possible.
Sergey Lavrov--the undisputed Dean of foreign affairs leaders. Would that ALL NATIONS have such a brilliant statesman.
"this translator is horrible, find a new one, with proper diction....you have millions spend it properly..."
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano Napoli, America, Rome,"

"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris Torino Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli America, Rome,,"
Chinese military forces and Chinese reconstruction will be the outcome of the “peace”.
Lavrov when will you teach the world about history of Russia ??? so that the world will know that in practice Russia is the last colonial empire. Moscow carried out colonial expansion in a similar period as Western Europe only is that Russia has maintained a colonial system of oppression and violence to this day that tries to maintain these colonies. Russia as a state is a colonial empire that blackmails its colonies every day that it will bomb them with nuclear weapons if they think about their own sovereignty.
Russia itself as a state is the last colonial empire in Europe that uses violence and a system of oppression to maintain these colonies.
Ukrainians are fighting Lavrov because they dont want to be your slavess and stop blaming others for your own colonialism.
Lavrov stop blaming the West for your own colonialism. Its the Ukrainians who dont want to be your slaves and thats why theyre fighting Russia.
"Yikes, the translator skips very vital pieces of what Lavrov is saying"

"West unified thx to friendships between countries. East is unified by force under the russian boot ( orc power,WAaaaaagh!)"
I dont understand his English
I expect you Russia and China to change this system that only western countries benefit of it.
"My question is if Russia is also part of group to encourage Iran to respond to assault by destroying oil production in region to destabilize USA Dollar and triggering a collapse of USA in national bankruptcy that cause liquidation of valuable public resources at very low cost to profit private buyers, much like when EU purchased Greeces private debts to make public debt and force national bankruptcy to cause liquidation to the private profits of buyers (connected to EU rulers)? Group that might include israel, treasonous Fed. government and other powerful forces, same private buyers that stripped Greece, and offshore others? Other reasons would be to change global power structure, rapid BRICS implementation, and what? God Bless., Steve"
"The most smart,famous and experience diplomate in the whole wide world. Lavrov"
The fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest benefit to mankind during the last century. 156 million people got their freedom from Russian imperialism.
Russian foreign minister briefing is not open policy statement.
I dont understand Exactly what you want?.. you have such a big country why do you want more?.. Genuine Question?.. even if you take Ukraine you will still have neighbours that you dont like. 🤷‍♂️
He understands history
Lavrov is talking nonsense. The war in Ukraine is about the Russian empire.
Ruz are done for....
Lets hope some peace is brought to.table.
"As a student of history, I know and respect the institution of the Russian Duma and I respect your character, looking at your faces. These are such wonderful questions one thing I can say as an American is that there is no longer a functional NATO for the foreseeable future.The American people are quite isolationist I doubt they would intervene militarily if Russia invaded France, which is, of course, absurd. I love Russian cuisine, tea, literature, music, art, history please consider me a friend of Russia.. As for what I'll call the Slavic world until a better term is found (remember that Eurasia includes Western Europe and China by many definitions), Russian dominance doesn't bother me. I see Russia as a stabilizing, focusing influence."
"Amazing peoples Russia 🇷🇺 , we love you for standing up for humanity and united"
The last true diplomat
"Everyone America rejects,lies about and neglects are welcome....it dont matter where you from , ..... And when we done we will stand side by side not over one another , but lifting up one another and get back on the path of evolution and move forward as the one race of human beings we are .... Change and come with us America., you too Israel... But either way we are going forward not backwards from here on..."
Serge lavrov
Criminsl Russia Criticise anything and anyone apart from them and their crimes.
"Saudia arab is biggest enemy of Islam... They destroy our religion they destroy Palestine Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen with his allay american..."

Two criminal nations meeting in a third criminal nation to discuss peace.
Russia wants to take Ukraine using Trump to get it by giving the minerals deposit in the Ukraine/ hope Zelenskyy says no to Trump
Isnt it Ukraine wants to join Nato? Even though Ukraine and Russia had an agreement in the past for UK not to join Nato??
If it wasn’t for Russia there wouldn’t be an Ukraine at all. Check your history people.
"America and European countries supported Iran by remaining silent about what it was doing, but rather attacking Saudi Arabia. Trump warned Biden at the end of his previous term, “Do not anger Saudi Arabia, it will go to Russia and China.” What he advised happened when Biden attacked Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia allied with these two countries that have a strong influence on Iran. Iran weakened and the American-European play ended. Bashar fled Syria, the Lebanese Hezbollah fell, and Western countries began to suffer economically due to the high price of oil. Now America and European countries are asking for help from Saudi Arabia to end the war in Ukraine. Mohammed bin Salman defeated them all with reason, wisdom, courage, and the team working with him."
"This is not some border skirmish that got a little out of hand, Russia is in full blown breach of international law. Russian military must withdraw from all occupied territory of Eastern Ukraine especially that of Donetsk. This is becoming an act of cruelty more than that of aggression. This should be the sole purpose of the talks and Russia must do the right thing"
"The bitter truth is that all Zelensky had to do to stop the relentless slaughter of his people was to state clearly and categorically that Ukraine would NEVER join NATO, that the Ukraine will NEVER allow foreign military bases on her soil and would MAINTAIN her neutrality. He also had to allow the Russian-speaking people of Donesk and Eastern Ukraine to exercise their rights of self-determination. Europe should have understood this...but Von der Leyen is a warmonger."
Theyre just dividing the natural resources between them.
Who started the killing Mr President and shouldnt they be made responsible
Yes the human race has reached a new low.
If mister trump last for 4 years term the far rights parties will take over in all europe
My predection is mister trump wont last for the 4 years term trump will be assissnated in the end of his first half term .and remember my comment .

"Made war ,to divide Ukraine"
Trump believe in peace?! pfft
I didnt realise the US was at war with Russia. I guess that Ukraine will keep fighting while the orange US idiot distracts them with his demented ramblings.
"Zelensky was not elected, he is just a puppet of the Satanic Illuminati warmongering machine."
Peace in Ukraine means that Russia leave and Putin is sent to the International criminal court
Did you know that Trump and Musk have a store on Payhip and its called Trump&ampMusk... Crazy
Let Mr Trump workout the peace plan... give him a chance.. who knows.. it probably works
So Ukraine waging war on their Russian speaking citizens in 2014? Not Ukraines fault?
The war is lost by Ukraine. The victor dictates the terms.
Zelensky needs Ballerina Lessons with Leggings
Churchill: war or dishonor? Ukraine: I want both of them
"go, Trump go! Too bad Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 will never help Palestine 🇵🇸!"
"Really? Trump wants peace? Why he is sending weapons to Ukraine, then? Russia was provoked, really badly provoked to this war."
"A reminder to our Al-Jazeera community, ZELESNKY currently has 4% Approval ratings , WHOEVER DEALS WITH ZELESNKY YOURE DOING SO AT YOUROWN RISK"

"USA planed a coup then baited Ukraine to join NATO . Russia felt thrtnd &amp attk it. A chance for USA to weaken Russia, make Europe dependent on USA energy , USA companies profit from selling wpns. When Ukraine wanted peace with Russia USA sent UK to thrtn it not to!!! Now USA changed the game it blames Ukraine &amp Europe. Wants to stop the war with Russia. Ask Ukraine to pay for the wpns &ampsurrender half of its resources to USA. Well played!!!"
"This guy is as clueless as he is arrogant.Russia: &quotAbsolutely no NATO membership for Ukraine under any circumstances&quot.USA: &quotWe dont care what Russia says, we just decided yourselves that there will be no NATO membership for Ukraine&quot.Yeah, right."
Zelensky is a little
So few &quotleaders&quot at such a large table. Is that by design??
"Zelenskyy forgot, when he met Europe without Russia"
"President Zelenskyy should not try to play against President Trump the way he is now trying to play. That is a huge strategic mistake in my opinion, if he wants peace. There is also something terribly wrong with too many current European leaders when not even trying to negotiate with Russia about peace during President Biden was better than President Trump negotiating about peace with them."
Zelinsky should go and clean his acts.. he gaslight and create war then cries he was not invited. His freind Biden is gone thats why he is lost ... What a Sham
Ambassador youre a foolish guy. You dont anything about diplomacy. I believe youre part banderite ideology.Zelensky is a war criminal. He should be out of the equation.
Can someone please tell the midget actor that hes NOT a politician. He has served his purpose and made a fortune in blood money in the process. Of course he doesnt want an end to the war...its not in his interest.
Trump is the puppet here for blaming Ukraine having started the war. Trump is out of order and should step down.
"Does the US agree with Russian claims that the Ukrainian government were neo-Nazis committing genocide against the Russian minority in the Donbas? If not, why are they not calling out Russia for the Ukranian invasion which is a violation of Ukraines sovereignty? Seems like a precedent is being set for invasions to happen on unsubstantiated claims. The US is not addressing the core issue and just wiping all the dirt under the carpet for sharing the spoils. Looks pretty bad."
Trump is a real estate broker of putin ... he is working for putin.
"Wow what a diplomat, non of Russia business if Ukraine joins NATO as if saying non of US business if Cuba installed nuke missiles on Cuba. Impressive reasoning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Trump will get it done.
"Zelenskyy is the man, he turned the Russians away from Kyiv . Trump had bone spurs."
Says the man who had talks about Russia in Switzerland without Russia.
THANK YOU FOR A VERY ACCURATE ANALYSES . HAD ENOUGH WITH THIS REPORTERS WHO JUST WANT SENSATION BUT NOT THE REAL THING.
The CIA will take care of zelensky shortly.
Just dont mention Ukrain joining Nato during the peace agreements. And pressure Russia by economic means. This Kurt Volker is not from this world. He is crazy.
Zelenskys impatients will creat more problem for Ukraine
This man has sense.
the baby which too much time in a lullaby
This idiot and idiots like him are what got us here to begin with
"To Remind our Aljazeera viewers, ZELESNKY currently has 4% approval ratings whoever Deals with him on Ukraine be knowing"
The war will end today if Ukraine stops being puppet of USA. And constitutionally agree not to join NATO now and in the future.
"In WAR , THE WINNING SIDE Decides TERMS &amp CONDITIONS WHILE THE LOSING SIDE Abides by THE TERMS SET BY THE WINNING SIDE!!! JAPAN &amp GERMANY LOST WW II &amp losers were not at the table, JUST LIKE UKRAINE WITH ALLIES HAVE LOST TO RUSSIA 🇷🇺🔥🔥🪆 European Union &amp ZELESNKY be humble 💀💀☠️⚠️⚠️"
Any leader could have stopped the war.Not Zelensky.He wanted and still wants the war.
"russian bots everywhere....defending the peace. It doesnt matter how you call it, in essence things always will be what they are and in the end they will be described as they are, pushing names to things witch they are obviously not, doesnt automaticly makes actions and other things that things, slavery will be slavery, oligargs will be oligargs, hidden agendas will be hidden agendas, no matter how many times and how much you try to rename them. You can fool some people for some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time...."
Europe and Ukraine will be squeezed by Trump and Putin.
Zelensky is a terrorist
"Russia is right, you NATO are warmongers and agressors. The war is NATOs fault. Zelensky is your puppet that you are discarding now."
"Zelenski is now irrelevant. The moment we pull out, Ukraine is done. They will no longer be allowed to use atacams or any satellite guided weapons"
This guy is a former Biden appointiee...a democrat.His views are totaly irrelevant in todays new politics!
"Now, a comedian vs 2 wanabe emperors"
Volker conveniently brushes over Putin’s remark that he refuses to meet with Zelenskyy. It’s always been about RESPECT.
Zelenskyy is a puppet
Thats because zelinskys an idiot hes got blinders on he will lose all of Ukraine if he doesnt wake up hes living in la-la land he himself is acting like a dictator he doesnt have very much choice at this point
"Take this dictator Zelensky out of the picture and you can have peace, this small action man lookalike is well past his sell by date, time for him to go."
It is very simple. If Zelensky dont like it he should focus on fighting without the US. What is he blabbing about
This guy is a pro USA . Good hes not in charge of NATO anymore
The Russian bots are out and about
"Almighty Putin gets whatever he so wanted period! Illegitimate Zelenskyy will soon be replaced. Irrelevant European scrambling for traction, where are so called strong European chihuahuas cowards with no Article 5. Remember Zelenskyy made it illegal for negotiations with Russia Putin now crying for a sit in the table"
"It was good that these useless German politicians were not invited to the talks, they are no more diplomats than Selenskyj. Give the power back to the people of Ukraine."
Why does Zelensky always grunt when speaking?
Trump is the man
Zelensky mandate expired long time ago. He is not Ukraine President anymore.
Zelenski is is a desperate little grasping at staws he has no diplomatic skills all he knows is begging for weapons and money and America has had enough.
Only adults allowed at the PEACE NEGOTIATIONS !
"lol Trump thinks that he can dictate terms to Europe and Ukraine, which is laughable. The US is a collapsing power."
&quotPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy&quot - his mandate ended on March 2024. He is a president of nothing.
ZELENSKY IS AN OBSTACLE TO PEACE! ONLY ADULTS ALLOWED AT THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS!
Zelensky is the worst thing that ever happened to Ukraine.... 0 diplomatic skills.... he cant even act like he has some...
I think the United States is ready to join the BRICS+
"Can’t imagine why Ukraine didn’t do the right thing when Putin invaded. In Bucha a brigade tied civilians hands behind their backs, raped women, Putin gave them medals for great job. Here trump announces Ukraines fault for not making the deal the sociopath Putin wanted. For them to surrender."
"Look at the double standards of Europe, they can go on a meeting without involving Russia, but when they get the same taste they become cry babies"
A weak US nowadays…
"The Europeans are being foolish. NATO lost to Russia, even donkeys know it! Trump is saving Europe from a worse military debacle. If the Europeans believe that Russia is a threat to them, then they should take on the project solely and commit more resources to protect themselves from evil Russia."

"The cause and foundation of the world problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,"
Why a muslim country like Turkey is in NATO?
American guy...lock up your daughters.
"Trump, no doubt is a tremendous personality but with unchecked ego and megalomania. He is apparently chosen by God to course correct America and the world but unfortunately he is surrounded by devils and monsters that he is unable to distinguish. If he has inner vision, he would know that Demon around him exposed in the Oval office through a little 4 year old monster and his warden. A spiritual person will easily recognize evil presence. Trump needs a spiritual anointing from a Godly Christian to free him up and work the mission God planned through him. His missteps are tremendous that can drive all his missions apart. He needs to drive away Elon and put true Godly people around him. His obvious disaster was Gaza ceasefire agreement and how managed to reach it. 2nd misstep is his announcement that Ukraine may be for Russia and the amplification of the same by his clownish Defence secretary in Europe. Europe is totally floored and humiliated along with Ukraine by this action. This will create an opportunity for Ukraine build up into a superpower by itself going through the hardships because the world saw how valiant and determined are Ukranians who single handedly saved Europe humbling Putin so badly. Trump tried to give him a helping hand bringing him out of the parayah status to the world stage again at the expense of Ukraine. This attempt of trumps is fallen in the crack. Trump is being humiliated in return. I want Trump to win with good people around to help him."

Did Zelensky packed his stuff ? I think he did n all “smart EU “ people Kallas included
Hegseth essentially said the US will cease funding this endless war. One of the many reasons Trump won. Over to Europe
Russia -Ukraine are Mother-Child countries. This jokers think themself are world bosses. World worried about nuke in europe. This jokers must Forget old days(Colonial mind set). This mother earth now have 8.2 billion. Jokers Follow other clown.
"The US has become a hinderance not a partner. Move away from the US and seek a different alliance. This country lies and creates chaos, blames others for its own problems and imposes tariffs to steal the wealth of others to support its own billionaire fascist state. It’s lead by a nefarious King only interested in his own selfish ends. He aims to divide and conquer, to defeat lesser countries one by one, making them subservient to his ends. There is no partner here. There is only evil. America has become evil, a pariah state, not to be trusted by any one, even the numerous other evil states. NATO is now dead and Europe needs to create its own power structure. Many countries will seek to unhinge from Americas influence. And so they should. Theres better deals elsewhere."
"Daddy Vladi, just spoken."
Youre dealing with real white nationality now&amp&amp#&amp@*#
EUROPE is weak…. Why does America have to do everything… Ukraine gonna give us all the minerals
Russia is not a country it is a vampire that has taken over other lands by force.
"Announce/ Declare all the invaded lands as buffer zones inside the UN-UKRAINE constitutional territory. 1. Declare them as buffer zones.2. Give promise that the buffer zones will be granted access inside the constitutional referendum of UKRAINE.3. Aproximate Russia into international legality for its last 3 year political and military acts inside the buffer zones, but not outside them.4. Acknowledgement of the social-political contexts of the buffer zones.5. Recieve promises from Russia that will not consider UKRAINE as its client state, when regarding UKRAINE request to join NATO or any other coalition that protects her and does not fight her. 6. Russia and Ukraine accord proper compensation for the damages outside the buffer zone."
My gut feeling tells me that China and the US are gonna move forward rapidly while EU/Ukraine are getting bogged down further and further behind. Lets see if this is true in 5-10 years
No NATO on the doorstep.
Make the Ukraine Russia again!
it’s all a joke . Why in the first place did those young people gave up their lives? For a free and better Ukraine 🇺🇦

Zelenxky must go
"How and why did the Ukraine war start? The US state department CIA coup detat in 2014, was after the many warnings by Putin, going back to the first coup in Ukraine 2004. Sadly most people dont realise the start of Ukraine war in 2014, was after the Ukraine government rejected IMF and World bank loans, Germany had set draconian rules on, including privatization for the Ukraine infrastructure, sale of agriculture land, mining rights and industries all must be available for sale, as collateral for the loans, these conditions also included austerity measures on public servants wages and all pensions.Ukraine rejected this offer, then took a slightly lesser Russian loan, offered by Putin, which included &quotneutrality for Ukraine&quot and a promised 33% price discount on the wholesale price of gas, a big help to their economy. Ukraine would have kept control of all their resources and territories. This angered the multinationals, who were behind the IMF and World banks and triggered the coup detat in Kyiv 2014, which was led by US state department-CIA, they use their propaganda machine to fear the Russians and incite riots in the capital Kyiv, many US politicians turned up for the protests/riots, even Victoria Nuland, she was there handing out cookies and manipulating the facts. The first casualty of war is the truth.The US state department, CIA then backed the small Western Ukrainian opposition, these were full of Neo Nazis fascist, they banned all Russian speaking media outlets, they hated the Russians living in Eastern Ukraine, with a long ugly history towards Russian people, who were also excluded, from the 2014 electrol vote.The vast majority of Eastern Ukrainian citizens, emergency workers and police rebelled against this Kyiv government, due to the ban on the Russian language, the Eastern Orthodox church etc. Even the Minsk agreements, were just a NATO delaying ploy, backed by Germany and France, to build up the Ukraine war machine.Its all about greed, hatred &amp $€£¥. Gorbachev Yeltsin and even Putin wanted European unification.No state can compete with US state department MSM propaganda, financed by USAID their lies and fear mongering, travels around the world, while the truth is still sleeping."

Let US and Russia settle this War for once and for all

criminals running white house .. they will do anything and everything for their personal Gain .. these disgusting Bastards have Zero respect for Humans
I can see Ukraine being sold out by Trump.
"The main losers are Ukrainians🇺🇦 they do not lose only their lives, homes, but also 1/3 of home-land plus the resources under the ground that mean the future and hopes of their children🇺🇦😌Shame on VZ."
Ukraine throws under the bus
"Sure, Putim wants peace. Simply give him everything he wants, and there will be peace."
Mają Putina za ćwierć inteligenta który zgodzi się na wejście wojsk NATO bez artykułu 5 .Jak wejdą tak nie wyjdą wciągnie się Europa w globalną wojnę .Ukraina chce się zaminować i potężnie uzbroić i stworzyć platformę partnerstwo dla pokoju po śmierci Putina .Tylko Wojska błękitne hełmy ONZ UN żołnierze spoza Europy i USA Kanady.Trump groził że wyśle wojska do Grenlandii na Ukrainę do Panamy Iranu KRLD niech tylko spróbuje może się przeliczyć a wojna handlowa to rykoszet
War does not end untold Russia is invaded by NATO!
Hey Al jizzeera i thought Russians only had donkeys to fight Nato tanks? So please explain how they are winning new territory EVERY SINGLE DAY
USA - The Big Satan... or maybe that has changed now?
"Wejście USA na Ukrainę oznacza 3 wojnę światową nuklearną oznacza bezpośrednie zaangażowanie USA w wojnę z Rosją .Trump pomyli się na Rosji nie docenia jej siły .Rosja uszkodzi reaktory będzie skażenie ,nikt tam nie będzie wchodził .Rosja może uzyć dużej liczby głosic nuklearnych tak myślę"
He better not suggest giving Ukraine to Russia
Remember trump peace for Afghanistan was put their enemy Taliban in charge without any input from Afghan considerations!
&quotPutin wants peace...&quotNever mind what that liar says. What does he do?He could ask his soldiers to drive home - and there would be peace tomorrow.Why would any serious politician repeat ridiculous russian talking points?
"God bless Russian, Glory to Russian in Jesus mighty Name Amen, Salam alaikum, wa alaikum salaam"
"God bless Russian, Glory to Russian in Jesus mighty Name Amen??"
"The cause and foundation of the world problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome??"
Leftist warmongers not having a good time
Two dogs licking each others junk.
I’m getting Kim Jong un Hanoi vibes with this
"☪ Asma bint Yazid narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: &quotit is not lawful to lie except in three cases: Something the man tells his wife to please her, to lie during war, and to lie in order to bring peace between the people.&quot &lt&lt Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1939 &gt&gt 🌙"
He speaks politely to Putin Russia has it own effects
"spent way too long searching for Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane, and now i know why it keeps disappearing. this isn’t some basic “think positive” book—it actually explains why some people attract everything while others stay stuck. applied just one thing from it, and my results changed fast. if you can find it, don’t sleep on it."
"With USA nothing is peace , it not about Russia at all . it about the money , land , grabbing black rock come to take all the goodies and the mineral . innocent people die fighting for the country thats never been for the peoples but for the political gain ."
"&quotPresident&quot Zelensky? His term expired, holds on to power through martial law, and has no mandate from the Ukrainian people."
This whole thing about taking Gaza was just distraction and it meant to bring back the IDF into the front line and that’s why they are now back in their positions
More like US wants to abandon ukraine.
All Biden could do was put more fuel on the fire.
"Biden watches how Trump spends Ucraine like a coin.. Wants Ucranian rare minerals costed 500.000 million USD as a cost of military help up to now &amp declares Ucraine will not return to the orijinal borders that means &quotGive your 1/3 of Ucraine to Putin&quotWhat did u do, puppt V.Z ? How did u destroy so beatiful country by beleiving in Bidon ?!"
The US has lost its proxy war against Russia.
Trump will sell his mother to make a horrible deal this is the type of person he is...
I can see Ukraine being sold out by Trump
History will remember Trump as the greatest president in American history . He knows how to deal with Arabs and Russians and understand they only respect strength . Watch them both do exactly what he says from now on .
This is a . He said people are dying we need peace and at the same time he wants to kick Palestine out of their land . This guy can’t be trusted .
Another lie from trump...trump bsing everyone all the time
now i understand why a propagandist was chosen as a chief of pentagon....
NATO is a terrorist organisation.
Why dont the Europeans step in and stop Trump surrendering Ukraine to Putin.
"The idea of a two state solution in the Israel/ Palestine conflict based on the 1967 borders is equally unrealistic. The sooner that unrealistic objective is abandoned, the better"
Get out of Nato. Thats the way to move forward.
"So NATO has lost and will be paying reparations. We warned Ukraine 3 years ago but the comedic nazis didnt listen. Now US walks away like they brokered a deal, when really they started it - and lost - again."
Now we know that snt tyrant dictator can attach any weaker nation and take portions of their land... And the world is ok with this. US will now take Palestinian and Russia will look the other way. Evil had reached the highest levels of government!
putin and trump share an expansion plan.
Well good luck Trump but its pointless if he follows through on Gaza attacks Iran and picks a fight with China should be stopping wars not starting new ones
I dont envy these other officials for having to pretend to take Hegseth seriously.
Im not going to hold off destruction for Free talking about hovering I should let the gambling commence but I Know it Leads to Destruction on a unrecoverable Levels but ok Good afternoon
Lets move ahead without USA
It’s time for the world to admit and accept the fact that Ukraine has lost the war.
"Russia should withdraw their troops out of Ukraine so Ukraine can rebuild their nation again and join the European Union and NATO, then Ukraine can use European defense system on their border with Russia"
Ursula von der Lying ...
NATO shouldnt have started the war.
De-nazify Ukraine ...
"It looks like EU leaders, and Germany have billions of tax payers to continue this war in Ukraine at the expense of their national developmental agendas. Please proceed with this failed project, otherwise Russia will decimate Ukraine (with or without western support) and cease more land."
I like the way USA president acts. He is a supporter of peace.
"NATO in jeopardy, USA did the right thing, Ukraine is subjugated by Russia, and WW3 is averted."
Zelensky got screwed. Guys a clown for listening to US. Even a half brain person knows that US will.. and always... abandon you after elections... except for israel.
Al jazeera usaid and soros propaganda
"&quotWe want a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine, but...&quot I stopped listening to Hegseth at that point. He is Trumps man, he doesnt care about Ukraine. The kowtowing to Russia is ridiculous and callous towards the nation of Ukraine"
"Nobody miss Biden’s speech.. he used to have issues even with a reading, what about to speak that smoothly and answering almost everyone’s questions! Respect for President Trump!"
So what? You liked it
"..those who impose the laws are those who command, if I imagine a globalized world it should not be like this."
No point in talks if Putin and his boyfriend in the White House cant be trusted.
"No matter how hard I worked, nothing ever changed. I was stuck, watching others get what I wanted with half the effort. I thought maybe I just wasn’t meant for success. Then I found Vibrations of Manifestation by Alex Lane. It took me days to track it down, but after reading it, my entire perspective shifted. This book isn’t just about positive thinking, it’s about rewiring your energy. If you’ve ever felt trapped in the same cycle, you might want to look for it"
"i used to think manifestation was a scam. tried everything—affirmations, vision boards, scripting—but nothing changed. felt like life was working against me. then i heard about Vibrations of Manifestation by alex lane. took forever to find, but when i did, everything clicked. it explains why most people stay stuck and how to actually shift your energy. after reading it, i stopped chasing and things started coming to me. if you ever come across it, don’t ignore it"
"This is good for the world. War needs to be stopped. We as a planet have to rebuild the global economy from Covid, this should be the goal. If wars are stopped and we all work together, we can get humans on the moon and mars"
You cannot negotiate with Putin and you cannot trust him. Trump should know this already.
Maybe the Israelis can go to Ukraine
my dear tump as much as i hate you i respect you enough to not trust putin coz he is insane to even start this particular war.... how can you knopw he wont attack other countries next to him
Free illegally oppressed occupied Palestine 🇵🇸
Fundamental human rights for Ukraine 🇺🇦 but not for Palestine 🇵🇸
"Putin will not stop. Soon, will be the second round. Tramp- trusts Putin and thats his biggest mistake"
Putin is not serious
"Levrov mentioned about peace talks so many times at UNSC but the zionists and neocons always think force can solve everything. DT must develop Ukraine into a paradise to relocate the occupying zionists out of Palestine. Theyll all be very safe, no Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthi, Islamic state and Iran i.e no need for &quotright to self defend&quot. Ukraine has a lot of land so no need to grab from Gaza and west bank. These people think we are all morons like some of them!"
The hypocrisy of the Western lame stream liar media calling Russsian president by name but adding suffix of president before Ukrainian head of state. Western democracy is the Western hypocrisy indeed.
Al Jazeera’s role in Hamas’ narrative warfareA series of internal documents exchanged between Hamas operatives in Gaza and producers at the Qatari news network Al Jazeera assesses that the broadcast of a recent Al Jazeera investigative program aimed to reinforce Hamas narrative of &quotvictory&quot following the ceasefire in Gaza and to justify the October 7 attack as a &quotlegitimate military operation.&quot The program also sought to cement the image of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as a &quotwarrior leader&quot who remained on the front lines until his death.
Two dictators only interested in power and control. Evil men......and let us not forget Musk.....another evil man. The world needs help.
NATO is there for defence putin not attack let the Ukrainian join you attacked them there just defending there country why can the Russians get help from China Korea Iran but Ukraine are not allowed help
Us British have in history helped shaped the modern world and with a new tax like i said of just 5£ a month for everyone we can help unight the world cos trump is not looking at history because last time the US stayed out of the world the 2nd world war happened and when it was over an they helped police the world we had peace an most presidents saw this
Everyone in the UK SHOULD PAY A NEW TAX OF JUST 5 £ EVERY MONTH TO PAY FOR THE ARMED FORCES IN THESE DANGEROUS TIMES AND BRITISH ARMY AIR FORCE AN NAVY COULD BE GREAT AGAIN AND ALSO HELP POLICE THE WORLD AN I DONT THINK ANYONE IN THE UK WOULD BE BOTHERED ABOUT PAYING THAT FOR PEACE OF MIND
So Happy with everything President just said. I know now he has 100% support what just said.
"Why doesnt Trump say those cool words that he said about Gaza in relation to Ukraine, he got scared like his defense minister."
&quotThe bullet goes off and nothing can stop it but a body&quot smmfh. This goofball has that part memorized
"It is a disgrace for the EU that it ignored Russia and its warnings about NATO expansion and the killing of Russian-speaking residents in Ukraine from 2014 to 2022. (In your opinion, should this have been silently overlooked?) After the warning that Russia would respond if even a single shell fell on the territory of the LPR/DPR, no one paid attention. So, who started this war? There is only one conclusion: the EU provoked it through Ukraine. Putin proposed negotiations and an end to the war a year ago! Do not forget about that. You are hypocrites and butchers!"
"Whether you like him or hate Trump, he is a man of common sense. Russia has beef with Ukraine and is never a threat to Erope and USA, and Trump knows it"
Now that Russia has won the war ...
Putin makes Trump sound like a child
If Ukraine wants to join nato Ukraine will join nato its not Putins or trumps decision. the uk supports Ukraine and always will trump hasnt a clue the whole of Europe and beyond should be turning our backs on the United States until this clown trump is gone ps come to Scotland and take your golf course back take it to Moscow 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Trump is Putins puppy
the &quotselfproclaimed&quot&quot master of &quotart of the deal. dont know there basics in any negotiation.. dont give the opponent what he want before the negotiation... unless you are weak and he own your.. putin owns trump. thats clear now .. hes is WEAK against putin just as Kamala warned us about.. you could have used NATO membership as tool in the box when negotiating with Putin.. but you are not smart enough to understand that.. you are a weak sorry excuse for a president
Trump is the consequence not the problem! Everyone knew our system is broken. This is what happens.
Allot of single Ukrainian women ....
Putin must have some real bad dirt on him
ou could have offered putin that if he withdrew USA guaranteed ukraine not becoming nato member. but you don have the skills for the job
Ukraine and Ukrainian people should never pay a penny back to US and Europe because it was a NATO proxy war which Ukrainian fought in their land after their leader Zelenesky sold to NATO. In fact Ukraine has lost so many things what their hard working people worked for thousands of years to accomplish them. Ukraine should get rewards instead for fighting NATO proxy war all alone.
Trade gaza for ukraine
Urrrraaaa
ukraine got a lot of potential. build your resorts there
It can be Good Real estate development with odea sea front property good &amp resort .. Cherish
It seems that only the EU is still interested in this conflict.
At last
"Donald Trump is a bully , that is his nature because he likes to bully weak people but he respects powers 🇷🇺 Norman Finkelstein 🇵🇸 🇺🇸"
"This phone call should have been made as soon as he got inaugurated, but better now than never. Congrats on Trump for willing to talk with adversaries. The fact that our previous president couldnt even talk to Putin is a disgrace to humanity."
"Putin and his friends knows exacty how to handle men like Trump, its already started"
"Muss ich denn nun weiterhin die Russen als Bedrohung wahrnehmen oder sind sie jetzt wieder unsere Freunde? Mir waren dieser Selensky und sein Botschafter Melnyk ohnehin hochgradig unsympathisch. Ah ja, verstehe...das ist euch egal ... Wiederaufbau...soll nur mit zahlen - ja, dachte ich mir schon!"
"Once again, a betrayal of an ally. Shame on the USA."
"The USA lost the War in Vietnam, then, They Lost the War , in Afganistan , against the Taliban, now, they are losing the War in the Ukraine...!...Trump wants to have some ....with Putin? but , USA , has lost . and Trump is putting himself, and the USA , to Putins Demands...?"
"Thats good news, this war must end."
Trump feels sorry for both sides beautiful people but he doesn’t heard him to talk about beautiful people children killed and on in Palestine
I dont believe this &amp&ampit. putin wants this to end .what a chicken
Putin wanted peace talks before the so started. Look up who prevented the talks
Trump says Europe has lent Ukraine the money implying that is wrong or evil. Has Trump looked at how the USA aided the UK before 1941 and after WWII? - Lend/lease &amp the Marshall plan.
"Trump says &quotPutin wants peace&quot. If he really does then he can end the war immediately - he started it. And who is to blame for these young men dying? Putin! Oh, &quotbut it would never have happened if I had been President&quot A deluded Capitan Bonespurs speaks again - PM Chamberlain negotiating &quotpeace in our time&quot again."
USA know about Russias military power
Trump is a clown
"He does not want war and does not want anyone to be killed in Ukraine or Russia, but regarding Gaza he said that all prisoners must be handed over on Saturday and if this does not happen it will be a war on the people of Gaza. He is a hypocrite and a big liar and does not care about anyone but money. He has no feelings, heart or mind and he is the most stupid person"
"Trump, by betraying the interests of Ukraine, completely discrediting international agreements on the inviolability of the accepted borders of states, the efforts of all previous Presidents of America, great Presidents, unlike him, a profiteer from the market, wants to resolve the issue of Ukraine very quickly. Not a single President of America doubted that Russia is Americas worst enemy. And Trump is on his knees before Putin. At any vile price. He needs the Nobel Prize, soon the submission of documents. He does not understand that peace obtained in this way cannot be awarded the Nobel Prize. This is not worthy and will discredit the Nobel Prize. Trump is going to meet with Putin, be friends and work with a serial killer ...."
If Putler wants to end the war who is stopping him .He is the one that started it .
"Trump: &quotIm just going to say s**t. I dont know if its true, or if it will ever happen, but probably, maybe, beautiful, bigly... ok thank you&quot"
Trump.joker foot putin seating....gazaholy place palisetani...
"Trump the dealmaker who plays his cards openly in advance, hands over everything, offers Ukraine on a silver platter to Putin and basically says to Russia: ‘If you want to occupy more Ukrainian territory, go ahead. We’ll wash our hands of it’. It turns out that Trump is actually a weak negotiator with no backbone. Trump’s statement means in fact the dissolution of NATO!"
What about Gaza they need peas us well
That gays loving “warming “ look history.
Putin will not accept what Trump want.
Trump for good and against evils.
"Oh no not talks, talking wont solve anything, just keep funding the war thatll fix it just ask Biden or Hillary."
"Great that they wanted peace ..that should be enough, and I had enough."
"I strongly advocate a Nobel peace prize for President Donald Trump, who's doing all good efforts to end this Ukraine Russian War. Undoubtedly, he deserves to be the recipient of the next Nobel prize for peace. Good luck to President Donald Trump."
Is it me or this dude keep adding numbers of deaths make Ukraine nice and send all Z Jews there
I remember your promised that you will end Ukraine war in 1 week
Trump 2 days later: we own half Ukraine.
Trolling
"full of Hypocrisy, make the ukrain a paradise park."
The result of all this is that Ukraine owes the United States 500 billion dollars. It is the best ally on planet Earth. I wonder how much Europe will require?
Do you understand how many kids being killed in Gaza . Gtfo
"US takes Greenland, Canada, Panama, Gaza. Russia takes Ukraine, Finland, Poland, Sweden. BIG FISH EAT SMALL FISH."
Good initiative dear Mr President Trump
"Trump and Putin are the BEST TEAM EVER!!! Communist or Decorate, the both of the gentlemen love their country more than most. Go TEAM!!!"
Russia will not stop until all its mission objectives in Ukraine have been fulfilled.
Young and beautiful soldiers. I love his language
"Dolund wants peace, Go Russia to meet Papa"
Zelensky is f up USA wants your mineral and Gas
"Putin no deberia salir de Rusia para reunirse con Trump, que vaya a Moscu."
"1. Nobody cares what Putin thinks, says, desires.2. The same for Trump."
"Wow, here Mr Trump has a different proposition! Shame. As far as Middle East is concerned he aims only for disaster."
The effing liar sold out Europe and Ukraine to his friend Putin.
Why Putin because zelensi is Zionist and it was planned by putin ?
NO MORE USA BASES IN LATIN AMERICA
This is a crazy man..Gaza are humans too
"Why does the Deep State love endless War? War in Iraq twice, War in Lybia, War in Afganistan, War with Iran, War in Syria, War with Russia. TRUMP ended the wars his 1st term then the Dems make them come back. REMEMBER"
Look how he stands…an absolute travesty
"Trump is going to claim this as &quotPeace For Our Time and all Hit I mean Adf no it is Putin wanted was &quotLebensraum&quot. Nothing bad is going to happen, right? Right?"
Wait a minute. He said he would do this on the first day of his presidency. Are his powers warning?!
What about the genocide you support in Gaza?! The hypocrisy is unbelievable
This is the same clown that said he will stop the war in 1 day
I seen more of this this guy in 3 weeks than the other old man in 4 years. This guy don’t rest! Who is he again
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
its funny how antisemites here cant stop yapping on Israel in a video that is not about Israel
"Talk went a bit like this TRUMP- “Hey buddy, you ever heard of Crypto”? PUTIN “Da!, how much you want”?. TRUMP- “I’ll DM you that number, just throw me a bone and whatever you want Comrade”"
Trump said that he would sort the problem out with North Korea but did not and North Korea is actually fighting with the Russian forces and supplying weapons and ammunition
Trump is stopping physical war but he is starting economic war. I see no difference. Economic war is even worse
Since when Trump works as a spokeperson for President Putin?
American bully
Ukraine is so screwed. What they got after 3 yrs of war and millions of dead and broken hearts. The buck stops with Zelensky .. he is the President....
Emperor Trump has finally brought peace to the world!
"Trump think he is the big boss!!??Well, if it is so simple to end the war by talking to Putin without Zelensky then the whole world is stupid idiot. It sounds more like announcement about how good Trump is than any clear solution!Just talking as it used to be!!"
"If president Trump succeeded to stop the war in Ukraine,, He should get Nobel peace prize ,, Forget about Zelensky"
"He wants Russia to keep 1/4 of Ukraine. Young beautiful soldiers? WTF.? Like Elons GMO kid said yesterday to Dumpster Donnys face,i want you to shut your mouth"
"President, it’s going to happen in Gaza again and you are the president now. How would we believe that it would have never happened war in Ukraine?"
PUTIN wants PEACE….. Then why TF did PUTIN invade Ukraine?! Ridiculous. Trump thinks we’re all stupid.
Why doesnt he threaten the russians . By Saturday
I never thought Id see a US president that was truly for world peace. Amazingly good to see.
Breaking News: Trump just said another lie. GREAT JOURNALISM!!
TroubleTRUMP Maker
"Ukraine mine as well use these four years to build actual defenses, this war is not over if they are not invited into NATO."
Take all the Ukrainians to Greenland for starters. Putin would love that!
"Please for gods sake al Jazeerah - change the title - Russia, meaning Putin, always was open to discuss how to end the war but the western terorist countries were not interested, Don’t do what other media’s do…"
Let’s not forget to mention the “Security on The US Tax Payers Money”! !srealie has to pay back all that money that was sent over to them and some of that money was sent without Congressional approval!!! There’s a reason we have a system of “Checks and Balances”!
Drump is toast. Soon he will be licking on that microphone thinking its an icecream ..
Now that Trump is president the Ukrainians should start learning Russian
Drump: All those beautiful young soldiers ..Putin: moves his chair a bit further away from Drump
"His lips were moving.You can always tell when he lies, his lips move"
Peace is made by Putin. Drump will say Thank You
Trump has a great idea of turning Crimea into a great resort town so that the oligarchs can build
"And those monsters that were allowing the war to continue,they werent seeing the pictures that Trump is talking about? And what about justice?"
What about shifting Israel to Ukraine all the nazis at same location
Never trust what Trump says. Believe only if Putin confirms.
"Putin didn't agree to anything, he told Trump what to do a great call an hour of taking detailed instructions from his buddy"
"USA frozen Russian assets , D Trump think Russia will forget I don’t think so, Russia never forget, even world knows D Trump are liar , before election Trump said he will stop GAZA war, and war stop, now he take advantage to grab GAZA, and now he will grab Ukraine also And after he will handover Israel, so no one trust him, I think World War 3 soon, don’t trust him"
TRUMP SOUNDS GAY - He keeps saying Beautiful Young Men
Make the Ukraine Russian Again!!!
"He never acts hard and arrogant when is putin or xi, i wonder why??"
All trump lies
"Actually, that war was there when you were the president. Why didnt you stop it?"
Negotiation - Trump to Putin &quotHow many Billions will you put in an offshore account for me to give you Ukraine?&quot
Putin never agreed to anything
"Nobody takes you serious about needing to stay secret like we once did, sir. You betrayed our trust on that end…"
Biden will die of heartbreak after hearing this news
9-11 would never have happened either would it Donald
"Trump has agreed to relocate all Ukrainians to a new Florida resort,named Zelensky - A - Lago. Take that, Putin!"
Will Trump get Nobel Peace Prize?
He probably reckons you can shoot a bullet horizontally round the world and it would come back and hit you
"Where is macron and starmer all those weak European leaders acting tough, towards Russia thinking there would be guidance from thier masters in Washington, Ukraine sacrifice its mens and territory for Washington in vain , all those weak European states acting tough better build up thier militaries instead of relying on handouts from Washington"
Dont believe anymore US
Trump is just the man stupid enough to allow putin to illegally take the territory russia seized from 2014. This will never be enough for putin allowing to determine he is entitled to rest of lost soviet satellite countries seeing how weak and divided NATO countries are. Thank you precious US for your stupidity and so called Democracy
"What about the 20,000 young innocent children.OOH MY god ,THIS Was The Plan All Along.MAD WORLD."
Starting the war and now playing if its ukraine fault.
The guy couldnt dare to say we will take over russia.
I love our president.
"Mr Trump how is your misleading plan takeover at Gaza, or you have changed because You already knew that something was unacceptable but only joking."
I like the way USA president acts. He is a supporter of peace.
Has not Trump says he could stop Ukraine war in one day?
"He finally found a “horrible war” that has taken “beautiful, young humans”. I think he inadvertently said the Middle East speech."
"Trump will have to be quick, Putin may not be around for much longer."
Who would trust the Americans in any alliance.
What happened to ending this war as a president elect?
Russia is gonna take over Ukraine and own It….
"Does Trump know and understand that Putins Russia has broken almost every agreement ever made? Edit, has have Trump! Two dishonest men with the most power......we are all going to die"
While we were told this was between Ukraine and Russia
What about making Ukraine the Riviera of Eastern Europe
Trump negotiating Zelenskys and Ukraines surrender. surprise surprise.
Trump Putin Xi = World Peace
Are all the 2000 pound bombs you sent to Israel a loan?
A very good call. Young beautiful soldiers.
An entire generation of young men on each side.
"Aproximately ONE-POINT-FOUR MILLION Americans died because you, Mr Trump, made terrible decisions. So why, should the world listen to you now? Youre more concerned about money how youre actually planning on getting the (blaming Biden again...) money back - sent to aid Ukraine - in lieu of natural resources. For you, Mr Trump, it was all about the money and never abour the eggs."
Im guessing Trump has given Putin everything he wants just to start these talks.
"&quotHe wants it to end ...&quot Pinoccio, if Putin wanted to end this war, he would have to pick up the phone, nothing more."
I can’t tell you my plan
I cant trust any channel now as there are reports of propaganda videos from media paid for by USAID
By Ukrain
What about making Ukraine a big resort?
"Oh, and also… I have a recommendation for your plan for Gaza. Why dont you can then take the 2.1 million Palestinians to the United States?"
L!ar who claimed (boasts) hed stopped the war within day one if elected...@djtrump..!??
Meet in saudi thats quite interesting
Can Trump be quiet just for one day please
Soldiers are beautiful
"Putin will not stop here, I hope I am wrong."
The respect he gives for putin by addressing president itself solves half of problem compared to biden
"Russia and Ukraine war would never begin, if US had honest objectives. To keep Russia safe and secured, Precedent Putin had to carry on the war."
"All your wars Mr. Trump had to end and your country USA end up losing a lot of money, killing so many people. No more nato !!!"
"Sure thing .Putin needs time to build up and regroup. Then, he will be at it again, unless he expires."
Wow. It’s all loans that Ukraine was getting????
"We are so far away from US, but we were so glad then of Trumps Election Slogan - AMERICA 1ST. But seems ISRAEL 1ST, UKRAINE 2ND, CANADA 3RD, MEXICO 1ST."
Did he say that ukraine wont join NATO .that itself proves war ended.Trump is really a master mind
America will fail hard
"Putin has already elected to escalate the war this is just him playing Trump for a fool, who desperately needs the war to end because fighting a world war would define his presidency and take up most of his time.Which he doesn’t want.Zelensky understands that Putin doesn’t want an end into this war but he does and he also knows that Trump is being played (no doubt) but he’s not in a position to say no to peace talks."
Tell the truth Trump there is no more money for war !!!!!
"He wants people &quotnot getting killed&quot at the same time, allows Israel to massacre Palestinians."
I like the way Trump acts. He is a supporter of peace.
No money that is why the USA has to end the war !!!
"so putin attacked another country, what did he gain from all the lives lost, some extra farm land?"
Trump is a failure. He has already conceded ukrainian territory to the agressor war criminal Putin.
"Putin will open with “I know of this great real estate opportunity in eastern Ukraine”.Trump has no idea, because he’s a moron, how much Netanyahu and Putin are playing him."
russia is weak
Get two Nobel Peace prizes ready for Trump. One for bringing peace to Ukraine-Russia and the other for peace in the Holy Land.
Fraudulent elections had the worst consequences imaginable for the whole World!
Donald trump is talking and doing more for other countries rather than his own US . That Bad very Bad .
"Zindabad,,Trump usa"
Liar liar pants on fire.
"look, Ukranians and US NGOs at work."
"Behind this, no doubt, VDL"
"Unfortunately, these people who are protesting have been gaslight by the opposition party PS and their leder Simecka. These people have it confused in their heads because they like EU, but in reality, EU leadership is not a democracy, and it is not there to support these people. These people have been manipulated by WEF globalists, Marxists, Communists opossition leaders, including Alex and George Soros, and are financially supported by Globalists Marxists Communists Alex and George Soros. Sadly, EU leadership is undemocratic, Antichristian, anti white skin, anti normal gender. Therefore, unti human, pro AI. These people are confused, because they think that EU is there to support them while EU is building Marxism Communism in Europe, demolishing Christianity, white people, children, normal genders. Basically EU leadership is Satanic and these people dont understand that. They have been brainwashed."
Respect za slovaske demostrante
"Thank GOD for the sane Slovaks. My Czechoslovak-born parents of blessed memory have been crying, knowing that you have a President that is so stupid. Does he not remember Prague Spring, 1968, Eastern Bloc?? Does he honestly think that Russia will allow Slovakia to be sovereign. God be with you as you protest! Boh ti Zehnaj. Svoboda🙏🏼❤️."
No Slovakian flag only EU.
Your so called Liberal Democracy survives only because of massive infusions of foreign capital. One issue such as the natural gas crisis disrupts everything.
crazy people
Fico blabla asshole communists shit communists putin dementia krueg schwein
"non-governmental organizations, USA, UK, Soros, they want to take over and subvert our beautiful Slovakia, but we Slovaks will not give it to them, we elected the government ourselves, with it behind us, and we stand with Mr. Fico, if the aggressors did not support them and did not pay them money for the protests, then those people would not be there, DISGUSTING, we will be able to stop it, Slovaks are strong, we do not want any USA or Ukraine"
Progressive collaborators and Ukro-fascists are a real disgrace.
This is not Kiev because half of the protesters are Ukrainian
Don't lie!!!!!!!The pictures are not from Slovakia at all!!!!!
"Democracy is the handwriting of the USA! Coups all over the world!! Find traitors to the nation, in Slovakia it is the opposition led by President Šimečko... this is a person who, with the non-governments financed by the USA, are creating demonstrations to remove the DEMOCRATIC! elected government led by Prime Minister Robert Fico!!... something similar happened in Ukraine and Georgia, now they have focused on Slovakia, because Fico who wants to do politics and trade on all sides of the world!!! Maybe one third are Ukrainians who want to dismiss the Slovak government!! This is again the work of the activists of ""Peace for Ukraine"", a non-government financed by Zelensky... I am Slovak and therefore these details"
Slovakia-Russia friendship
Philippine President Marcos will be next
"Brainwashed and organized by USAID, NED, Soros foundations.."
Soros money stretching all the way to Slovakia
Shows that the clampdown on USAID will not extend to money for regime change operations etc
Best regards from Poland my neighbours
"Fico won the democratic elections and I want him to do what we sent him there to do. Those who are protesting... they don't even know why anymore, they are activated by hatred."
you can tell if its a fake protest just from the flags. If its EU flags it has a 85%+ possibility of being fake. If Slovakian police control it they will disappear in 2 to 3 days as lack of funding from the west. Stay strong Slovakia. Fico is a good politician he cares about Slovakia
They are Ukrainians not Slovakians
Same textbook protests everywhere .
”…….We can stop humanitarian aid……..”EU can also stop it’s subsidiaries to Slovakia. Slovakia is very far from being a net payer too the union.
American puppets
Fico need to respect the will of the people and step down
Paid protesters again?

hahahahahah LUDI HORA ot Slovakia
"never trust usa, european union"
You dont eant to be near the satanic EU. The future is Russia! Wake up and move away from the West!!
Haha another cia plot
"Be careful Slovakia, Seems like a Coup by America is coming."
"To those that support Russia in the comment section, let’s see how you feel if Russia takes over your country. Belarus, North Korea and Chechnya are all such prosperous and lovely places to live!"
"these are not Slovaks, these are antislovaks retards .. real Slovaks love Russia"
All my love to my Slovakian brothers and sisters 🇸🇰 from Venezuela 🇻🇪
May I never be made to incarnate on this earth again.
Hmmmm who is funding
Protesters are paid actors paid by the US and EU countries.
"Please use your brains, its obvious who is protesting... many of those signs are in Ukrainian."
Get rid of him
USA will be the shortest empire ever . There is no way they can be the world’s police for 100 yrs
So this leader went to Moscow to represent himself? Leaders of this generation
"They like trump , one day trump will demand Slovakia like Greenland , GAZA, Canada and panama"
ANOTHER COUPS.....More destabilization tactics..
EU funded protestors
Not another Maidan and color revolution. How can people look ate the hypocrisy of the west commiting a genocide of semites and labeling themselves as protectors of human rights and freedom... wake tf up
Cia moshad agent big probable in the world
Seems like they shipped them from Georgia
"USA id is folded, apparently EU aid is still functioning."
So they dont like cheap gas?
If these people are right may the government fall
"BEFORE I THINK THE SLOVAK PEOPLES ARES MATURED, WHAT A BAND OF LUNATICS."
They don`t love Russia but they want cheap minerals. It`s not about morals and interests.
"This is the Work of Americans. What is wrong with Slovakia supporting Russia? Russia has cheap gas for Europe Economic growth, what does US offer? Expensive LNG... Use COMMON SENSE before joining stupid protest"
Human are very stupid
"Slovakia should pursue closer collaboration with Russia, which is the regions global power."
This is CNN News Agency
"The prime minister hypnotize by putin,"
"Another regium change. First serbia, georgia ukraine george. All regium change."
"There are some misunderstandings in this video. Gazprom(Russia) should deliver gas to Slovak border, this was and still is the deal. Gazprom should deal with Slovakias neighboring states to deliver gas into its borders. This was an agreement pushed from Russian side. Ukraine already announced 2 years ago, that they will stop this transfer, since Russia is bombing them every day and killing their citizens and destroying infrastructure. Fico did absolutely nothing to prevent this halt of gas. Fico also did not go to Kyiv to negotiate, but to Kremlin. He did not negotiate about gas and oil on his visit, because there was no outcome of it. They negotiated for 3 hours with Putin and nobody knows, what they were been talking about. Slovak citizens do not know how he travelled to Kremlin and he disappeared for 2 weeks during the Christmas. He has an obligation as prime minister to report, where he has been. He never did it. They found him eventually on new year in Vietnam enjoying penthouse mansion for 6200 Euro per night. And this is what triggered the protests. So, no CIA, no Mossad, but arrogance of power from his side and unprecedented insult to citizens, to democracy and to future of Slovakia."
Thanks for reporting
"Another Colour revolution attempt by the CIA,they failed in Georgia now they want to try the same thing in Slovakia mainly using Ukrainian refugees."

"Their flag is same as russia with a symbol to differentiate, why being bother by pro russia.thy re mostly russia before"
This people are truly stupid
USAID. Funding facist left and anti democracy.
Solovokia Prime Minister is a corrupt man. He get money from Russia to sale Slovokia to Russsia. He is a traitor…
CIAs puppets protestingFree Slovakia from US puppets
How much mossad and cia paid them
another maidan try?? sponsored by Soros?
"Trump ascending to presidency, protests in Serbia, now Slovakia... Coincidence? I think not!"
I pity them they should ask zelenskey how the market be ?
More staged demos brought to you by USAid.
They are misled people
Thanks god there are European leader who keep contacts with Russia
"Well done to the Government of Slovakia on putting the interests of their country first. The people will benefit more from being neutral than choosing between two enemies. If working with Russia on deals that make the cost of living cheap, so be it"
One thing I cant stand is kissing booty.
"Looks like CIA, Mossad, Mi6 doing its Job joining in the protests"

That has controlled of the universe let’s go world because I still love the world like Mr. trumpet Mr. Trump the president the 47 president because I’m 47 and the Eagles will win the Super Bowl
"God bless Russian and Slovakia, Glory to Slovakia and Russian in Jesus mighty Name Amen"

"The cause and foundation of the world problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,"
Usa want others Ukraine
Even Slovakians are protesting the Doncic trade

Slavic people see Russia as their motherland.
So many russian bots in the comment section
Ukrainians should kick this puppet Zelensky out of office and hand him over to Russia
"Thanks to lord Putin and Russia, now all is clear that Joe Biden the old comedian ice cream grandpa with no sense has make all the money and blood that sustained him to eat more ice creams.More to come from Russia"
Ukraine can’t win this war. Ukraine is only bleeding Russia.But Russia is sucking Ukraine little by little. Now Ukraine’s strike in Russia killed just one person or affected few people. But Russia strike killed several people. Russia’s population is more than that of Ukraine. So if Ukraine keep using this style of fighting then how can they win the war? If you don’t seize fire Russia will gradually reach Kyiv. Ukraine can never win with this tatics
Sweden is the head of the beast. Ur busy fighting ukraine to defeat nato when sweden is the heart n soul of the operation. Readjust ur bearings n win.
More non-military targets by the Russians. UKRAINE still targeting Refineries



It looks like comedian Zelensky days are numbered
Zelenesky must do the right thing simple you cant fight with a bear never look now biden hes gone he leaves you alone like a ghost
"One thing we need to appreciate about russia is that they more concerned about innocent civilians, even if they are of the enemy country, than the dumb country of its own citizens."
"You feel sorry for yourUkraine father, Qatar fool?"
"Interesting, when Russia hits a apartment block, Zelensky calls it terrorism, when Ukraine hits civilians, he calls it a successful strike!"
How about What Israel IS doing in Gaza?
keep updating us
Russia commits war crimes!
Why are we still talking about Ukraine in 2025?
You said Russia 🇷🇺 is weak
"Bravo,Russia!!"
Come to the table for peace stop asking for more weapon delivery
The Russian terror regime at work
"If Russia was specifically targeting civilians there would be thousands dead like in Gaza. I noticed the fake North Korean troops now being reported as disappearing from the battlefield, how convenient. So many lies about this war."
Terorist
Its only a dummy president like zelensky who will request for more arms to fight in this situation instead of peace.
You wanted to fight Russians. Now you have it!
"only difference is, Russians are intercepting their missiles"
Stop using civilians buildings for military storage
"I’ve never seen terrorism like this. Targeting people, people sleeping, children, the elderly and even the young. Guessing, that resident Valentynas news reports and video coverage of the targeting of people, people sleeping, children, and the elderly in Gaza, West Bank and Lebanon is fake news."
Theres nothing terrorist attack Ukraine is in war
free Palestine
"Russia has every right to defend itself. Boris Johnson, Zelensky and the Biden administration are to blame for Ukraine. BORIS JOHNSON’S MESSAGE TO UKRAINIANS ON APRIL 9, 2022: WE MUST CONTINUE THE WAR On April 9, 2022, Boris Johnson arrived unannounced in Kiev and told the Ukrainian president that the West was not ready to end the war. According to Britain’s Guardian on April 28, PM Johnson had “instructed” Ukrainian President Zelensky “not to make any concessions to Putin”“Ukrainska Pravda” reported on this in detail in two articles on May 5, 2022. April 25, 2022, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. wants to use the opportunity to permanently weaken Russia militarily and economically in the wake of the Ukraine war. According to the New York Times, the U.S. government is no longer concerned with a fight over control of Ukraine, but with a fight against Moscow in the wake of a new Cold War."
collateral damage.
ukronaze banderas kaput..Slava Russia🇷🇺
All the complaints about the eternally stoned clown Zele are the work of him and his Western masters.
"One apartment building struck, terrorist.An entire city and hospitals bomb repeatedly with over 50 people dead in Gaza, Israel has the right to do because Israelis are white. Nonsense to Ukraine."
"Well, yes, and when the Ukrainian fascists kill civilians, what is that like? The Ukrainians don't need to hide among civilian objects."
This is the result of Zeleneskys dumbness.
"Soon everyone will discover the truth about this attack. Russia fires thousands of artillery, missiles every day for the past 3 years and the number of civilian casualties is astonishingly low because Russia has a strong track record of never attacking civilians, unlike Ukrainien Neo Nazis ."
Slava KOKANHE
If its related to the Ukrainian MP...then the MP has to issue public apology
Why hasnt Trump ended this war with one phone call on day one?.
That resident speaking needs to have a look at what Israel is doing she’s soon think again Israel is committing genocide
Has Russia taken responsibility for the attack?
Better to get rid of the comedian clown president
"The hypocricy of Al jazeera pretending to side with Ukraine and Palestine? Its the same people fuelling both conflicts, no mention of corruption, ultra far right wing nationalists, nazism and even more corruption in Ukraine"
The Russians have extensive intelligence and knowledge of who and what is staying in Ukrainian hotels. Generally NATO or foreign intelligence personnel covertly operating in Ukraine.
Stupid Ukraine are targeting Oil refinery But Russia target civilians at Ukraine.
Zelenski kept bombing Russian speakers in the east and the dope thought he was bigger than Russia 🇷🇺. Little he realise NATO the West used his country. Once a always a……sign a fkn peace deal and stop kidnapping people off the streets to fight your lost war mr unelected nobody.
"When Israel does the same thing even worse in Gaza, the US Media ignores it…. And the US government actively supports Israel …."
Russia is the empire of terror.
Zelensky is irrelevant and illegitimate.
the civilian apartment was ukraine military command centre...ukraine shall stop using civilians as human shields...russia has a right to defend itself
"This is how it happens when you are fascists, everyone gets what they deserve."
"The old lady surely cant say she watches global news and not know that this is exactly what happens all over the world when there is a war in your borders. Palestine, Israel, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Sudan, DRC, CAR, Mozambique and now Ukraine/Russia. Its all the same acts of humans killing humans claiming some political, religious or economical disputes."
"West wanted this,this war could have been avoided, but because of the dictatorship from zelensky"
"Ukranian drone in Belgorod region had struck a family home. Mother and a 2 year child killed, and the father and another child had been injured and were being taken to hospital."
"Russia struck military facilities. Unfortunately, Ukraine has a habit of using buildings among civilian infrastructure. This is a fact. Even their air defence systems are positioned in residential neighborhoods. Russia has already addressed this at the United Nations Security Council."
"The Russian Investigative Committee has released distressing footage showing the bodies of civilians inside a basement in Russkoe Porechnoye, Kursk region. The video depicts bodies wrapped in bags amid building debris, while Russian servicemen examine abandoned military equipment. Authorities accuse five Ukrainian servicemen from the 92nd Separate Assault Brigade of mass killings, including Senior Soldier Yevgeny Fabrisenko, who was reportedly captured and confessed to murder and sexual violence. A Russian court has ordered his detention as investigations continue. Ukraine has not yet commented on the allegations."
Putin is attacking civillian buildinfs while Ukraine attacs military targets.Shame on Putin
Al Jazeera is a news organization defending Nazis in Ukraine and ISIS in Syria.
The craziest and most destructive war in a long time. Its got to stop!
Russia &amp Israel are two terrorist states
Is Qatar beefing with Russia? Never seen Ljizzers target any other country but Israel
"As Israel says, its collateral damage. Its war. Zelensky men are hiding in those buildings."
Ukraine is using people as human shields. Thats what isreal says
Why killing innocent civilians. ?
You dont usually do inside stories about this horrific things that Russia commits because it not Israel
I dont know right are you sure
Denmark will be harmed the most with the proposal as Maersks main base is there.
"everything is anti semitic, russia or china....europe and usa have never done anything."
Nordstrteam was bombed by the only country who had an incentive to do so.THE STINKING USATHE GREAT SATAN BUMBACLOT 
These are not perceived risks. They are real risks. We are being attacked.
These are not perceived risks. They are real risks. We are being attacked.
The only threat in the Baltic is the United States of Insanity and Nutto
"LOL. After losing election after election, Europe NATO facist left is going to do a Romania coup detat by faking Russian interference to open a new war front."
Repair &quotNord Stream&quot to stop this
you want war whit putin?? dont think trump help you they want greenland denmark colect tax what a joke
Solution: Denmark ban all ships bound for russian ports. Cite national security as justification.
Subhanallah
The Cold War is about to get boiling hot.
"All this pressure in a coking pot, fear ruling common sense."
Im against russia anything from 1970 to now for obvious reasons. But we need help stopping trump now. News upon us as acurate will be to the deaf soon. Going down hill with hate here and european to Ukrainians are next from us or US if we dont get help stomping trump out. Maga idiots are now going door to door asking for money to fight Ukraine
I see this video only to learn English language
Yeaaaah..... Now that trump is in power America is not interested in Syria anymore.
"Are the Syrians so obtuse they don’t realize Russia worked with Iran to run torture prisons,steal billions , are giving shelter to rescued war criminal, “basher of the Syrians Assad” ?"
The leader can’t be this dumb! Maybe he’s as bad as them
Sanctions shouldn’t be lifted if Russia is allowed to keep these bases… 
World is on the way of revolution
Is this a good thing or bad thing for Syria??
So not lifting sanctions from Syria means the president wasn’t the problem from the beginning
Well hope relations get better for Russia and Syria
Better keep Russia. Dont trust the West.
"Well done Russia, finally with the good people. Asad was a brutal murderer, supporting him was a bad idea"
"Hi everyone, I am under treatment, day by day health condition is going down"
"Remember Assad is in Russia, be careful of Russia,there might be a hidden motive."
"They claimed in the Western press, that Russia already move everything out the 2 bases in Syria"
No money no experience to run the country by these groups of people like Iraq.
The Russian went to Syria to see if the people they bombed for 10 years are still alive.
The new Syrian government can look at Assad and see how steadfast Putins Russia is as an ally.
Russian bots malfunction in the comments.
Russian Bots already working hard here
Seems like there is going to be another dictator rising.
Arabs will always be a useless mess who foreign powers can exploit. From T.E Lawrence to todays scoundrels.
"Its like playing chess. Rather have good relations with Russia. Dont forget, dont even forgive, but we have common enemies"
They should pay compensation to every families killed due to the air strike or they should leave
They’re so desperate
Did russia support assad?How is the new leader of Syria friendly with russia?
Don’t mess with the Zohan!
Very dangerous to keep Russia in Syria. Keep them out
.. better to deal with Putin than America....
Russia invested a lot of money in those bases.
"Al-Sharaa know that once Russia leaves, the West will prey on Syria."
Some comments here are really SICK. Are some of you Russian security agents under arab nicks or are you just illiterate?
Russia seriously wants the syrian people to hug their former terrorist oppressors? Yeesh.... the cynicism.
This looks Russian plane for rebel took Syria
The syrian victory should not be Stolen by americas cia and mossad
Ahmad Al sharaa Al Julani is silent about Syrian areas which Israel illegally Occupied in recent months and also about Golan heights. Ahmad Al sharaa Israeli agent.
The current administration should demand for extradition of Assad The killer
"It will be a mistake to tell Russia to leave, the moment they leave Syria should just forget about everything."
Cant Mossad the Assad.
"Russian presences is important the new Syria leader is smart ,he knows the way"
Nothing changed in Syria...need to rebuilding whole country...good luck
An agreement with russia is not to be trusted and they do not keep their word. They made the Minsk Big Treaty with Ukraine in 1997 and broke it......
"US and arab nations destroyed syria and their narrative like al Jazeera , cnn"
Arrest him! For warcrimes commited in Palmyra and Aleppo.Never forget the carpetbombing orderd by Assad and Putin.
Russia is needed for Syria otherwise their territory will illegally occupied by zionist which gets support from USA and West...
Messed up what they did to syria
Its sad what The US did to Syria. That country will never be the same.
"Imperial nexus - US, UK and TZS regimes."
"Osama bin ... no one among Arabs has or adopts such a name , never , except the guy himself who did. so, ermmm... !"
"Wow, this is great. Russia and new Syrian regime can form a really good partnership."
Revenge mentality is never healthy. Syria leader might consider healthy options.
"nah the military base is doing just fine, dont you worry that much western corporate media..."
White washing HTS
Russia bombed them every day and killed thousands yet they say iran is the enemy
Russian diplomats ....for New SyrieAnd New Politics middle east Surviving ....
Syria should re-establush their relations with Russia. There ate no permanent friends and enemies in international diplomacy.
"so , isnt it embarassing for assad now ??? what you gonna do with assad president now by trying to establish diplomat with current syria government<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
Russia is the one who asked from azard to flee and not to fight. Thats the deal
Serya Should Have Good Relationship with Russian Government.Dont ever trust Western Hypocrites
This is how asad is coming back
If they are smart they get the Russians out as fast as possible. Russians means unsecurity and trouble wherever they are in the world. And after bombing civilians for years how can they even have the stomach to send a delegation.
"Removing Russia would be a dumb thing to do, the only counter weight in the region.. having them leave would definately destablise the area."
Wow shocking..
I know its politics but this Russia was their main enemy backing assad. I would say go away putin
Syria must re-establish relations with Russia and Iran.
Assad was real leader never bow down to anyone!!!
Wish the visit will make the diplomatic relationship between Syria and Russia great again to have business involvement and technology.
"Today January 29th is Hind Rajab’s one year murder anniversary. @AJ I have the greatest respect for your reporting, could you please make a video or even a community post? She needs a tribute. We cant forget her one mere year after, when there is still no justice."
Dont be dumb. Just dont forget how many of your fighters were killed by the Russians! I hope and please come to your senses.
One moth before: russia bombing rebels Now: lets shake hands and act like we havnt been hostile and at war for years
Bruh russia supported syrian regime and the opposition is working with them how dumb are they
"In Syria, militants armed by the Pentagon fight those armed by the CIA---Los Angeles Times"
"Zelensky this idiot, is going to start the third world war, just because he cannot get NATO premium subscription.These guys are nuts and are acting like terrorists with no concern about their own citizens.God seriosuly, going against a country with secodn greatest nuclear arsenal, with drones !!.Putin needs to be appreciated, for holding the urge to push the button."
The shepherd boy and The Storm.Shadow
"GREAT, RUSSIA HIT UKRAINES FACILITY MANY TIMES IN THE PAST . SO SHUT YOUR MOUTH RUSSIAN MORON LIARS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
FAB new drones 1000km
"Putin will never see Zelenskyy as the equal he wants him to see him as.Z thinks puffing his chest is going to get better peace talks, but it’s just bringing him closer to bad bad stuff I feel."
Zelensky is King of most currupted rezim
"So, Putin is going to appoint someone from the Kremlin to negotiate on behalf of Ukraine?"
No one believes nothing of what russians say anymore. But russians are actually stupid enough to believe that the people of the free world are so stupid that they buy their mouth-farting
You guys are afraid of Putin why? he is a dictator and a criminal.
"Putin dont want to have negotitions with clowns like zelenski and other EU and or american leadears, bcoz most of them are liars and dont have word of honor!"
"NO ONE, ABSOLUTELY NO ONE can TALK SENSE to A person who is A MAD, PSYCHOPATHIC, NARCISSISTIC KILLER DWARF DICTATOR WHICH is what PUTIN IS! MAD VALD HAS Broken the LAST 26 AGREEMENT/PACTS and TREATIES with WORLD LEADERS and COUNTRIES. Because of his character and EGO he CANNOT STOP, no matter WHAT! if he loses face in MOSCOW he is FINISHED. ONLY ONE WAY WITH PUTIN. HIS WAY ONLY!!!!!"
Putin is scared of Zelensky no. Zelensky really humiliated Russia and Putin.
"We know the answer.Only one country can sanction the hole world  meanwhile no Educatio,no infrastructure,no healthcare.But World  dominance is USA mindset"
Aljazeera can still broadcast from Russia.. no ban. That says how they work/broadcast Stories.
Its inaccurate to call it a &quotconfrontation&quot in 2022 - it was a second invasion by the Russian Federation (after that of Crimea and Donbasin 2014) . Russia does not deny invading in both 2014 and 2022 so you dont have to be too deferential to the Kremlin in your terminology.
I think Russia leader is not ready for peace
"Zelensky seems to be very keen on leading the world to the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. One hit on these and there will be leak of radiation. Yes, the clown seems to have been given enough power to cause such one that potentially endangers everything you hold dear. Imagine, being threatened by a clown, with mental decline and with only experience in acting career using it to sell story how he cares about Ukraine and that serving as a jumping board to money as his greed knows no boundaries, a man who thinks &quotits my way or no way&quotnever optioning for compromise, after all he banned negotiations. As such hes not only a danger to Ukraine, but the whole world. Although seems that many ukranians chose him and what youre not changing youre choosing, he seems to have a lot of supporters there which is concerning as to how delusional some people can be, even though his term should of been long over by now and an actual Ukranian president in charge, not a man with experience of kissing another man and one with two passports. When it is the time to realize its not anymore about providing aid to Ukraine. If they chose this path and want to go all the way, even to the end of the world, theres only so much one can do to support them. Its no longer about victimizing Ukraine, but seeing Ukraine as a number one enemy to national security with its reckless acts."
I am still amazed that n established news site cites Russian government press releases as serious source of information. Like they say almost 3 years in a row: it was just debris falling down and causing a tiny fire.
"Russia Paper Tiger, you want to talk after they bombed your refineries."
Putin is like a baby who didnt get what he wanted throwing his toys out the pram because he wanted one more toy (country) to play with
Are you sure? Russions seldom react with trustworty stories
Anything russia claims is a lie. Imagine living under that mafia regime.
Russia claims
Putin doesnt want to accept defeat. Face reality Mr Putin
Condemned attacks?
Putin comments everyday?
Zelensky has been having negotiations in the absence of Russia. Cry baby...
Why does Putin condemn Ukrainian attacks?
Useless Putin everyday is dreaming sleeping like a fools everyday fighting like a boyscout war Wake-up F guys useless Putin
Putin is so strong I would not have that patient Ukraine would have already been part of Russia since 2014
The Presidential Inauguration was on January 20th. He said we are on day 95 of Trumps first 100. Its only been 9 days. Big miss.
Russia cant even defend its own borders hahaha
attacking nuclear facilities is the biggest existential threat to mankind
"Putin is a whining crying little bi7ch, he starts an invasion and then cries when the victim responds. Russians are crying babies WAW WAW WAW! LOL"
oh no !!!
Russia is loosing west will make Ukrainians win.
"I feel that ,the world is more prone to a Nuclear war under Trump evn though I support him."
Putin call Zelensky illegitimate ....what about Putin fake elections
Russian are crazy enough to hit their own nuclear plant just to blame Ukraine
"This is trash talk, muddying the waters, zelensky is a dictator using marshall law to cling on to corrupt power, without genuine elections there is no legal person to sign any agreement, but Al jazeera know this ey"
Propaganda channel
Zelensky is not long for this world.
This is funny. Putin will soon tell Ukraine to leave kiev confused man
I cant stand that presenters accent!
Russia thinks they can attack but cant be attacked.
Putin is soo childish.. he is scared with Zelensky putin is the incompetent one
whats wrong with putin lightning warfare? i never heard a lightning warfare ongoing for almost 4 years since 2022
Stop  war
I have no idea how Putin can show himself on TV. He has been shamed and destroyed by Ukrainians. The 3 day special operation is now 3 years behind causing Russia many life and economy.
"YOU ARE LYING AGAIN - PUTIN SAID THAT HE OR HIS PEOPLE CAN TALK, BUT NOT TO ZELENSKY, BECAUSE HE ALREADY TALKED TO HIM IN 2022 AND WHAT?"
Zelensky: &quotNobody believes in our victory more than me. Nobody.&quot - TIME Oct 23
Putin is a sick man !!!! Diktator!
Zelenski is no longer the legitimate President so why would Putin talk to him?
On dit Kiev mène des attaques contre la russie .dites plutôt l otan qui lance des attaques.
"lets not forgetting the two leaders background facts, one is from showbiz and the other is an ex kgb leader.both have a significant difference on the approaching methods."
Putin is so soft on Ukies
Putin Only Scared of Zelenski
"Putin is still DISRESPECTING Zelenskyy, Maybe Zelenskyy should refuse to meet with you, Putin. Are you not both the leaders of your separate SOVEREIGN country? No way would I accept being blocked from joining NATO."
Aww Vlad is crying
Putin spews lies and Aljazeera prints them. I expected better from this channel :-(
"I started the war, but its your fault that I started it."
"Zelenskyy ended terms of Ukraine president 20 February 2024,, He is not any president,,, How anyone can deal with Zelensky"
"It is looking increasingly likely that this will end soon with the negotiated settlement that could have been concluded years ago, but for the interference of Boris Johnson who has the blood of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers on his hands."
no news abt nuclear plant attack.
omg the county your invading is fighting back what ever shall you do lol complaining about it just makes yall look stupid
"Ukraine is like a child brought to this world if a brother and sister had a baby, zelenskyy is fighting for his life not his country"
Ukraine and US will replace Zelensky with someone else to talk peace with Russia.
"YouTube, EZEKIEL 38 wars. Countries and communities destroyed for opposing the Palestine occupation. Somalia Sudan Libya Yemen Afghanistan Iraq Syria Lebanon Palestine Russia Rohingya Uighur Kashmir Kosovan Iran. Destroyed countries arent allowed to function again."
Russia is terror state and expansionist 
Wow
I dish the media can just shut up and stop cheer leading this war. Report facts please
"Chapter: The Approach Of The Hour Anas reported that a person asked Allahs Messenger as to when the Last Hour would come. He had in his presence a young boy of the Ansar who was called Muhammad. Allahs Messenger said: If this young boy lives, he may not grow very old till (he would see) the Last Hour coming to you. &lt&lt Sahih Muslim 2953a"
5 years fight
Putin on speed run to make a new Northern North Korea
Russia has right to do whatever they want
Putin is exercising his usual patience and restraint. Amazing.
Thanks to President Putin for having interest to go for discussion. I appreciate the statement not with Jelensky. The world knows why the war began. The nations providing fuel to keep burning the war remain constant should negotiate to remain peaceful to stay Russia away from this war. Russia has right to keep his border secured to ensure that non can stop Russia.
"Ukraine should go to elections, who on earth will that man be in power without anyone voting him, imagine if hes African leaders, he could have been Called all sorts of names"
Stop war then Zelensky.
"First, Zelensky is no longer president. Stop calling him that. Secondly, Zelensky will throw children into the meat grinder. Just like his idol Adi H. Its time to end this nonsense. Russia has already won."
Z should nullify the rule to not talk..so ridiculous. B idens Obama Clinton stated it in 2014.
"We have huge volcanos and rivers, dont need nuclear power plants.You know energy is just about Heat and Motions, right?"
pop goes the weasel
Al jazeera why do you lie so much about Russia? You support Gaza but not Russia? Wtf. Ih right you guys are qatari aka americans servants. Pathetic. I just deleted your app due to severe misinformation
The world gos broke Russia gos up up and up
Why should it end soon? Zelensky is on record last week to have requested Trump to hold on his efforts to hold peace talks because he needed more money and weapons to fight Russia for a stronger negotiated position. This comedian is sick
Already know who the enemy is that wants to continue the war who tells lies that sides with other enemies and a friend who tells the truth like he really means it. Russia Friend Ukraine Enemy.
War mongering here pretending Ukraine has a chance 
again lie Trump has no power over whats going on in Ukraine so we are not going to report on it major news outlets
what brain you have in the panel still think ukrine are winning and russia lost more people in the war wake up you look the wrong news and can you not see the map its rusia go forward and still you think its be russia stop fight if trump say so not only you are dreaming hole west same morons
Why nobody wants to tell the truth about this deadly war?
my biggest question is why people arnt salivating about getting there hands on Russian oil fields?
"Ukraine will never get back the territories seized by Russia in this proxy war. If anybody thinks Russia should give back territories seized from Ukraine, he/she should first ask Israel to give back territories seized from Palestine."
Two giant liars. Trump naiveness to putin calling him colorful. Putin will use every avantage of deception. Seen it before. The green men in crimea. Putin swore thats wasnt him. Then the belarus buildup. He swore it was for war games. Senile biden didnt fall for that but was a coward. Just give Ukraine weapons to destroy russias bases. Russia can fire Iskander missiles at ukraine but fire marshal Biden restricted the use of us weapons in russia. Biden was a rock behind Obama but a disaster on international affairs. He did create the envy of the world economy though. Thrmp will have a breakdown soon.
"Your speaker in Brussels, sounds like the military commander of Ukraine"
"If Putin is not stopped in Ukraine, he will continue on to another country. And that one may not speak Russian."
That is not how there Trump is going to drop the war.... Trump need to call two of them sitting down..... but u say putting most stop the war . Russian is not a small country..... that Trump we just talk like that..... Russian...is a super power
&quotRussia has already lost the war&quot - Joe Biden April 23...
"The MAD PSYCHOPATHIC KILLER DWARF PUTIN cannot give back territory. lose FACE, or SURRENDER. HE IS A NARCISSIST and keeps going until either ELIMINATED by RUSSIANS or He DRINKS the wrong cup of POLONIUM TEA. He is PARANOID to the EXTREME and CANNOT make any concessions to ANYONE. He NEVER HAS YET in his life of EVIL OF KILLING! JUST ANOTHER MAD DICTATOR!"
Ouais OPEX listen to Trump i dont believe that poney stop the warr
"How come a State Overthrow does not start a war, how come that ?!State Overthrows start wars !How come those terrorists refused to put their guns down when they were asked, how come that ?!"
"Well I EYE saw FJB doing NOTHING NADA but going on vacation after vacation, seeing thousands just being killed and here I see Trump doing...."
Putin lies whenever he opens his ugly mouth! Riga vatnik is clueless. Ukraine will not become pro-Russia. Russia is a genocidal fascist kleptocratic imperialist state.
NO ARE YOU FN CRAZY? RHETORICAL QUESTION
What the heck? Trump must win or else? Because Trump lost election that was why the war started. And now the war has not yet stopped after Trump has won. I think Putin wants to rule the world and he got Trump to help him.
American policies as long as trumpet is making profit the war will go on zelensky is just a small fry
Justice for jews
There is clear sign that Ukraine losing the battle if it continues
"The russians soon will put Putler to sleep, and the the war can end."
Your days are numbered funny man
"putin strong leader, what a joke. Russian economy is about to collapse, the Russian army is dwindling and having to import soldiers from prisons and other countries. The economy of Russia is about to collapse that’s why putin is desperate to end the war before he’s removed. Terrible leader, mistake after mistake and as I mentioned driving the Russian economy into the ground. I hope the USA keeps supporting Ukraine until putin is removed by his own cronies. 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦"
The UKRAINE CRISIS STARTED 2012 WHEN UKRAINE ELECTED A PRESIDENT FROM THE EAST WHO SAID HE SUPPORTS RUSSIA SO WE ARE NOW IN 2025 AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT 2017 JANUARY TO JANUARY 2021
Dont these guys read the news?
If this is about sphere of influence I don’t see how Putin has any other option by now but to take Kiev. There are no deal that can make ukrainians in non occupied territories elect a pro russia government. I don’t see how Putin can make a deal without effectively losing ukraine forever. How can he spin that to be a victory at home?
Who is this Putin stooge?
"Yes its Aid but its not free, it will be paid maybe with interest as soon as the war stop. Same in Russian side."
24 Hours =100 Days = 6 months = 1 year = Trumps Mathematics = Trumpomatics.
"The war will last as long as Russian troops occupy Ukraine, in some form, conventional or unconventional. It is a large mistake to think only in terms of conventional war, front lines, armies etc. Compare the realities of lethal resistance in WW2 to the age of drones. The ability to cause casualties from a distance by almost anyone that can use a joystick will make any occupation very costly indeed, as well as all the infrastructure damage in Russia that would happen also. Costs mount, political will changes. In the end 100,000s perhaps millions of lives will be lost and Russia will make a humiliating withdrawal, This is the only inevitability, how long, it could be decades."
"Russia cant win ever, it will just be a bigger loser."
"We see right through these media entities that promote Russia phobia, where is the neutrality?"
"This guy from Brussels is smoking something, why do they let warmongers lie on international television? NATO must stop its expansion thats all. This is not news its propaganda. Why dont you quote Mr Putin instead of people analyzing lies, saying what Russia never said?"
Europe will not see peace if Russia does not feel secure
Nothing but IMC BS here.
"Wow.. seriously, how tf do you have any credibility?"
One side analysis
"They say What should I write, you are words. If I think, you are thoughts. If I ask, you are prayers. If I tell the truth, you are just nonsense."
"Biden was fully aware Russia was going to start the war, and sounded multiple alarms publicly just before the war started. Obviously Putin sent him multiple messages &quotIm going to start the war if US / EU dont and Biden just ignored it. If Trump was presdient instead of Biden, the war simply wouldnt have happen. A deal would be done since both Presidents were interested in making deals instead of wars.Ukraine/Russia now need to wait, because Trump has a lot of other priorities on his plate.Anyway naturally the war will end later this year, when the last billions of US supplies run out, bcos Trump wont be sending another batch."
"Russia is not under any pressure, that is perceived by the media. Russia will end this war on its terms. The threats of sanctions are just the definition of insanity... Doing same thing expecting different outcomes."
Ukraine is Trumps Vietnam
Michael is your typical Western propagandist.......absolute verbal diarrhoea. How these clowns cant see the cause of this conflict and that Putin will continue into Europe is just beyond belief. Where do you get these clowns ?? Absolute joke.
"Putin invaded Ukraine, Putin alone caused the deaths of millions of innocent people and soldiers on both sides. Putin is a threat to humanity…"
In the year 2022 zelenski said no to talks with Moscow end of story
Remember the last time said trump wants peace... Me neither
"Poutine is very funny when saying that if Trump was president, the war would have never started... how many presidents and advisers told him not to start the war? even Antonio Guiterez went to Russia to tell poutine not to start that war... he shall blame himself"
"Ukraine is almost out of gas , no US supply/support means that they are running on fumes."
Zelenskyy stressing dfk out 3 yr war hes aged 10 years 
"Glory be to God. Trump has finally realised that America First = Ukraine First. The interests of both great countries are tied together. Trump did not realise this while on his campaign trail because he is a stupid person. The smart people around him have told him that Ukraine’s victory is vital to America. It is critical for America’s geopolitical future in the world. Trump now understands. Glory to God. Glory to Ukraine, Europe, the USA, The West! 😊"
"&quotRussia and Ukraine attacking each others territory&quot. Yes, but its more Russia attacking and less Ukraine. "
"Al jazeera one sided story,, not inside story"
Is Zelenskyy going to be like Israel 🇮🇱 and refuses ceasefire and peace deal ?? 
"Zelensky passed a law that he introduced into the Constitution so that no one can negotiate with RussiaLets not forget the negotiations in Turkey when Boris Johnson said that Ukraine would fight What kind of peace negotiations can you have with a comedian and a lunatic...These politicians are only fighting for their own pride, not peace negotiations... Now maybe soldiers from NATO member countries, Russians, Ukrainians, werent killed in this war"
"Zelenskyy does not want peace, he is lying when he says he wants the war to end the war soon , he is delusional , his plan for peace failed and now for the negotiations he is demanding things that any nation in the position of Russia would reject ."
"Amazing, Palestinian and its supporters wanted the war in Gaza to end but supporting Putin to continue the war until all Ukraine is destroyed. How ironic."
Trump did not solve the Ukraine crisis in 24 hrs . Now he shift the narrative to the war will not happen if he was president. A boaster will always be a boaster. An empty talker will always be an empty talker. Trump will solve neither the North Korean crisis nor the Ukraine crisis. His America first policy will make US the enemy of the globe
Absolute nonsense
Ukraine parliament has passed law to ban all efforts to broker peace between two nations Russia and Ukraine. So how can peace negotiations take place until this law is repelled. Further PUTIN does not consider Zelensky legitimate president of Ukraine. Who will sign agreements
Ukraine could not even win the war with a 200 billion dollar donation
"Putin will play Trump like a fiddle , then Trump will give Ukraine to Russia on a silver platter , but gift wrapped first."
Stop war between Russia and Ukraine.
"Why should Ukraine deescalate, Russia started this war by invading Ukraine and they need to leave - end of story and all countries should support Ukraine and anyone that does not should face the most severe sanctions like China, India, UAE etc"
D world wants change .
Mr. Putin is a strong leader keep going dont bow down.
Putin is destroying both Ukraine and Russia
Its time to build a global platform for digital democracy so we can vote for principles and policies instead of personalities and political parties.
When are you guys ever going to stop warmonging? You guys preferred war to peace. You knew Zelensky yanked off the peacd deal. You knew North Korea didnt participate much. You knew Russia never wanted to militarily occupy Ukraine as Russia doesnt have the numbers. You knew Zelensky was lying all along. You now see the war was unfortunate for Ukraine.
Zalensky doesnt want the war to come to an end. Bcoz if the war ends it means zalensky looses the presidency and money
"Nobody knows the amount the US spent on Ukraine, it jumps from 60 billion to 175 billion to 250 billion according to Trump."
"What happened to putin threatening the world with nukes. Ah, you guys forgot about that huh? This channel is so biased"
"I agree, Ukraine has been very unfairly treated and deceived by the west, giving up its nuces for security guarantees, the west OWES Ukraine a answer"
I have come to the conclusion that European elites are not rational people
"Is the war popular? That’s a crazy question. So many people killed, injured, displaced, mentally incapacitated, and no hope in sight. What’s going to end this war? I think it’s a few dozen nuclear weapons if all involved don’t smarten up and stop fighting."
Russian propagandists
"Yeah, its too late in the game for any negotiations. The war is lost by Ukraine. Unconditional surrender is the only practical solution for Ukraine at this point. Hitlers Germany also refused to admit defeat until Hitler killed himself, then Keitel signed unconditional surrender. Post war settlement is Russias business."
Al jazeera uncle sam propaganda 
No just getting worse
"Putin wants every country arround Russia become an ally, or become a barrier for Russian territory, or at least wont be enemy.Its all about security, hes over-protective to his own country.He wants to protect Russia regionally."
I love President Putin. He strikes as a very patriotic man of strict principles. He is articulate and very intelligent
"In other words, ZELENSKY is going back to his stand-up comedy gig. Unbelievable!"
Russia isnt at war with Ukraine but a Special military operation otherwise Ukraine will not be existing after 3 years.
The cross dressing comedian dual Israeli leading Ukrainians to their downfall. Zelensky isnt even an ethnic Ukrainian. Hes a Israeli
Is Russia not part of Europe? Why do European leaders think that Europe can be safe without considering the security interests of Russia? Why is the moderator aligning with pro- west sentiments against Russia?
"Putin does not need “a lot of force in order for him to pull back”. He needs diplomacy, to be engaged and his concerns addressed. That’s all. Getting him to pull back “with force” is the exact recipe to “put the world at a dangerous place”. You don’t want to mess with Putin."
Aljazera should stop bringing war mongers to this programme. Please consider inviting those who are more objective to the programme.
russia is not our enemy. the globalists are.
"If I thnk like Trump does and I thnk I do, what Zelensky needs to understand that just because I may agree with Putin on that sentiment @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwE6DbiQM9c&ampt=135"">2:15</a> does not mean he is manipulating me or that I agree with what Russia has done. But Im also not Russian so even though I may not agree with what has been done im sure they probably feel differently about that."
Grind on .
"A delusional felon, potus wouldnt know if he pootin his pants."
I had no idea a book like The Censored Guide to Wealth on Bovolorus even existed it’s like a hidden treasure
Ukraine is not to stop fighting but it will be forced ro capitulate. They just dont have enough human resources to continue this war
"Mr Brussels, let’s not normalize land grabs and allow the bullying of other humans by Trump. You want to normalize a Palestinian situation for Greenlanders under Trump?? No, Trump needs to find other toys to play with and leave other people’s lands alone. In any case, Denmark needs to free Greenland! This neo colonialism must be stopped before it’s too late."
"Well Putin did not just wake up and start a war. No one here is talking about the CAUSE of that war. Broken promises, treatment of Russians and the language in Ukraine, bringing NATO to its border, Ukraine elections and Zelensky. Zelensky is clearly a puppet of the west. Would the usa and allies allow Russia to set up a military base at THEIR border? Likewise for Russia."
Ukraine is a terrorist state
Zelenskyy the buffon who sound like a drunk commedian diesnt want to step down so he will continue the war
"Unfortunately the war will grande on. Wec have too many warmongers in EU and NatoRutte,Von Der Leyen,Kallas"
O je Trump will say stop the war know and Putin will listen ha ha.
"Zelensky is not a president anymore, his term has expired long time ago."
"YouTube, EZEKIEL 38 wars.Countries and communities destroyed for opposing the Palestine occupation. Somalia Sudan Libya Yemen Afghanistan Iraq Syria Lebanon Palestine Russia Rohingya Uighur Kashmir Kosovan Iran. Wars bankrupting the Western countries."
Eu need to wake up
"One of the distinguishing marks in determining a person’s level of maturity and open-mindedness is the way he interacts with others — others who hold ideas that contradict his ideas and opinions that oppose his opinions.I have never seen characters as repulsive in a dialogue as characters who attack you because you simply “don’t resemble them” and don’t hold the same beliefs and don’t support them when they present their ideas…They only expect you to support them, praise their points of view and approve everything they say… Otherwise, there is a problem and a tense atmosphere between you…"
Quickly fast forwarded it and all the guests are westerners. That must be objective lol. Didnt even boither to watch.
Putin totally kissing Trumps a**
Is Russias war against Ukraine genocide?
The world is still hopeful The Honourable President of United States Donald J Trump is capable to end all wars going on. Please stop all wars to stop all unexpected deaths.
"When some red velvet cloth went missing on the Day of Badr and some people began to say, ‘Perhaps the Prophet took it &lt&lt 3.161 Jalal - Al-Jalalayn"

"&quotForget about Russia, the real threat to America is Israel and the Israel Lobby &quot Julian Assange"
Ukraine is in trouble
"Mr. President stopped the genocide in Palestine. I know you’ve taken millions and millions of dollars from Zionist, but where is your soul?"
Miss Trump why does the West wanna be at war with another Christian country time to end the war in Ukraine you know it was the secular Biden administration unnecessary war nobody to date has explained as to why this is in the interest to the American people other than to create jobs give me a break
"Glory be to God. Trump has finally realised that America First = Ukraine First. The interests of both great countries are tied together. Trump did not realise this while on his campaign trail because he is a stupid person. The smart people around him have told him that Ukraine’s victory is vital to America. It is critical for America’s geopolitical future in the world. Trump now understands. Glory to God. Glory to Ukraine, Europe, the USA, The West! 😊"
Im not putting up with any country negativity
Mr President D Trump is friends with Mr. Prestident Putin.. I like Putin too... end the WAR sirs its just the matter on how ... they both wonderful presidents im sure they will sort ot out from SA 
Please end this war Trump so many lives lost
And the orange blob is destroying the U.S. from the inside.
He is a liar always
Donald Trump will do what he does which is unknown. What a stupid statement lol
"war mongers create wars to make profit , steal resources and get cheap slaves to build their empires"
"Trump, need to visit Ukraine (or Russia ) and get a ground level/realistic perspective on the current war crisis. Zelensky has left his post multiple times. Don’t have it in you as your head won’t fit out of the Oval Office."
Hello
Does it take this long to make a phonecall if you dont want to meet Putin personally? Just start somewhere
"Trump, come on!!! You are starting out like Biden. The border is being sorted, so get on a plane and go to Putin!!!"
China is waiting guys. Do not forget the silent one
"Can i have their number please , lol"
There ia actual ppl in this world that really need them all to work together 
They should all jusy have a nice whiskey and have a chat.
Asian invasion
He will never make it through four years.
"Another clown has been drawn... He couldnt even do anything to Kim, but took a swing at Putin. Go sleep it off old man, youre drunk"
"Trump, keep your nose out of Russian business! Rather criminalize the lgbtq+ bullshit!"
shut up and prove 24 hour russia-ukraine peace...
Putler just want Ukraine land  he has spoken
"Xi Jinping: Guys, my buddy Trump is following Chinese lunar calendar thats why his 24 hours is longer. Hold your horses ok?!"
Trum is worried because Russia 🇷🇺 is in big trouble
"72 hours have already passed since he became our president, and the war is still going on."
Putin is not destroying Russia and Trump should have more respect for this great leader. This is the US/UK proxy war so they are the ones responsible. They need to leave and never go back. Stop the bullying. It is time for peace and time for good relations which you cannot have by being threatening.
24 hours to end this war: he failed already.
Trumps head is as mashed as Bidens !
"Ya, Trump is a Narcissist like his buddy Musk and Putin."
"Anyone thinking Trump is any different from his predecessors is delusional, he is a warmonger &amp will escalate the conflict in ukraine !!"
Putin is President Putin &amp President Putin is the only one who can stop this war within 24 hours. It should be on his terms considering Azov was killing people in the regions Russia took over. Azov is to blame. Nazi’s
"Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russias ambassador to the UN: &quotHe is not responsible for what the US has been doing in Ukraine since 2014, making it anti-Russia and preparing for the war with us, but it is in his power now to stop this malicious policy.&quot US has done nothing in Ukraine since 2014! When you have a different nationality and living in a different country, you have to ABIDE by the countries rules or you can start an ARMED REBELLION in witch the LAW &amp ORDER WILL INTERVENE! This, UKRAINE CRISIS has an starting point: THE REBELS in DONETSK &amp LUHANSK! US was not preparing for war against Russia, it is the KREMLINs war in UKRAINE that put ANTI RUSSIAN SENTIMENT IN FULL THROTTLE!"
"Trump said he will stop war within 24 hours, bull shi"
Which deal is that
"Millions voted for Trump. Americans are trying to fix their country and they found it fit to vote for trump. He is not a criminal. Ukraine must figure out, how to end this battle."
"In this case he is right. And please look at the SNL 2016 show, where president Trump acts as himself with 2 look alike comedians. Might change your view on this bright and intelligent man. Changed my mind about him."
Trump knows he cant stop this war. Hes a businessman selling himself. People thought Mexico was gonna pay for the wall he never built? Never.
People should understand something very important!Not only Russia economy is destroyed!Europe economy I not in better position!What about Ukraine economy!People should take seat and talk
Day 2 under Trump and the war continues...
Trump said hed end the war on day one though...
"Putin is destroying Ukraine and Russia, but only Ukraine will survive... Trumps silence on Putlers war crimes is simply unforgivable. I dont understand how he wont speak out against the butchery...clearly a lack of both morality and empathy."
THE ENGLISH ARE DESTROYING THE UK
"Trump First step,Is media conspiracy, to talk everywhere,to talk everything while hes ignoring the main threat,BRICS,"
"What happened to, &quotIll end this war on first day!!&quot???...."
So Putin’s the one who won’t make a deal. Not Zelensky. That’s certainly different from what the bots were claiming all this time
"Trump looks even worse than Biden in terms of ukranian war. Threatening a nuclear power, Russia, with more sanctions and &quotthinking&quot about continuing giving weapons to Ukraine is very dangerous and it means he is playing the globalist game."
If that happened in Ukraine.. everybody media would be shouting a terrorist attack.
I guess there’s a reason Vlad doesn’t travel abroad much.
Ukraine=European Pakistan the real terrorist state
Ukrainian terrorists
"You have to remember that any form of Free Trade, Peace etc. deal from the US has always been dubious e.g. the fall of the soviet union / Russian people wanted to be part of the West but the US wanted to collapse the Russian economy and even with the SWIFT finance system / US WTO / US IMF / US UNSC all outdated. The US no longer believes in a rule / law based world e.g. Israel / US ? Western countries condoning Palestinian genocide and daily murdering children through starvation / ignorance og the Zionist anti life governments. Russia don't fall for US verbal diarhia or deal making."
Usa destroyed every infrastructure in iraq in the first day of war. Russia still behind.
The kiev regime uses such methods. This is no longer surprising.
“Remotely” doesn’t that mean the people who done it have to be close by and watching when they pressed the button if that’s true then doesn’t that mean they’ve literally got people inside Moscow?
Looks like an inside job. Talking “coming from the top” type of a job
is Russia weak because they keep killing there leaders??
Israel don't want peace
"Hey, Russia must say peace is coming soon!"
"One God creates all! Why does God create one side to go against what the other side wants? Why are so many motivated to play chess or competitive sports? God pits you against each other and really what it wants is to see you fight, and its inevitable that someone will lose- which is what it perhaps wants even more than winners- especially if the majority of people lose if they are on the side of Ukraine or on the side of Putin. And if Israel should win after becoming Nazis themselves, is that really winning, and is God really on their side if it makes them behave and look so bad?"
Donald trump is an idiot and unskillful president
"The deal is close, we've been hearing it for the past two years."
Terrorism is terrorism.. The west seems to believe that terrorism is only when it is attacked
At least this time they are not blaming Tajiks
This is pure evil and terrible thing may his soul rest in peace

the only influence this guy has is the influence people give him Tell him to F off
Urge? What happened to the 'Art of the Deal'?
"It be clear it’s Zelensky, the EU, and UK that want the war to continue. Trump is still supplying Ukraine. Why shouldn’t Putin hit Ukraine?"
When you will going to stop the genocide in Palestine??
How about demanding Israel stop the genocide?
Why don't he not talk gaza
"Israel and Russia, the two the most stupid country in last years, they outplayed themselves with stupid games and USA thought is some business here, that's the USA mistake, they cost them a lot, could be the main reason of falling standard in USA."
I demand Israel stop Gaza strike
He is trying hard to stop war between Russia and Ukraine so he can focus on middle east and china
Put a clown in the Whitehouse And this is what you get Trump works for Putin for personal gain Nothing to do with killing innocent people that’s really the joke of all times
America have lost its dominancy.
Silly rabbit you can start a wild fire but can’t control the wind
Just stop supplying ukraine with weapons to attack russian people.
We hold Chinese 🇨🇳 Xi Jinping accountable for the damages caused by the Russian invasion because of his quot no limits quot support for Putin's war.
"Arms, tech information, and Nato expansion were who's planning..."
The war was started by the cia under Obama in 2013 and usa has been using Ukrainians to fight their war . Now trump wants peace to save face because the usa can't defeat russia
"99% of the time Trump is lying, the other 1% is unable to be determined... Pointless"
Sorry but Palestine needs a peace deal much intensively
Neither Putin nor Xinping cares about Trump
Trump now increasingly sounding like Biden.
"🇨🇦 If Ukraine had a beautiful beach he could build hotels on, it would be Putin and Trump sipping cocktails in an AI video. "
Al Jazeera a so called fake news channel supporting terrorism.
It didn't surprise me. Another fake ceasefire.
"at this point zelen has to say whatever eu/nato wants him to say ok here we are WWIII once again the west nozis wanna dethrone east rus there's just no peace in the northern hemisphere amp never will be peace facts: theyre all infested w/ parasites controlling their destructive acts<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA""></a>"
Trump have similar approach with Russia as North Korea as it seems to be on CBMS but on the practical step it is different from the other side or one side
yea put neva wanted this war..nato keeps using ukraine as proxy to encroach on rus border w/ missle eu wants to seize rus trillion$ in resources/minerals so they can get their governments out of default that's all this is..very sad because both ukr is basically rus..they speak rus..same dna..theyre being used zelen is a puppet..an actor..yall dont wanna see his debaucherous lifestyle before he became puppet wow
Vladimir Putin and Trump Admin is a Regime and is illegitimate.
at a prisoner exchange is welcome because the treatment of ukrainan prisoners is dreadful. also rarely mentioned is the treatment of civilians in Russian occupied territory. they are offered eviction or forced to renounce Ukrainian citizenship.
People are bored with ukraine. Thats what happens when you try to act heroic while begging money in every corner of world
russians decided not to colours their eggs on UA soil instead they decided to colour at crazy wife.
"Putin sending a strong Christian signal , yeay , happy Easter "
".Every time, when any religion is used for political purposes or, broader speaking, for secular and material achievements, it transforms into heresy and even pseudo-religion. Obviously, heresy in Christian church is anything contrary to the very spirit of Christianity. The Sermon on the Mount emphasises moral teachings of our Lord. He proclaims clearly and unambiguously that “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God” (Matthew 5:9). It is also crucial to understand that all the texts in the Holy Scripture are spiritual parables, which should be understood in the developing spiritual context of the entire Bible. In the reference to getting quot swords quot (Luke 22:36-38), our Lord means spiritual weapon. In regard to real material weapons His command in Matthew 26:52 is absolutely clear: quot Put away your sword. Those who use the sword will die by the sword quot . In our example, the Moscow Patriarchate not only openly supports Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, but also tries to give it spiritual and ideological justification almost as a “crusade” for “traditional values” and “purity of faith.” The public statements and actions of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Rus' alone have already accumulated more than enough of this kind. The war in Ukraine is basically generated by the perverted religious-nationalist ambitions of the totalitarian-“Orthodox” leadership of Russia, dragged by the Moscow patriarch into “spiritual delusion” in the form of a mania of self-righteousness. The Moscow Patriarchate has slipped into heresy and turned from the Orthodox Church into an aggressive (i.e., anti-peacekeeping) heretical sect, whose adherents are unlikely to be called “sons of God.” Current crisis around Ukraine is not only political and military, but, in first instance, ideological and spiritual. From certain perspective, it appears as a sort of test of ideological and spiritual standing. Respectfully yours, bishop Vincent Berg."
trump lied to america he never could end the war in ukraine fooled you once fooled you twice
It can only work if the other side does the same
putin and russians lie always. It's a propaganda for doting.
not telling the truth. the media stations should send journalist to see for them self. Putin have done all he could for many many years to not try be open to the west. So strange.
Putin the war crime decided not to skip church this time. Amuzing.
"Allah's Messenger said, quot O `Aisha! This is Gabriel  sending his greetings to you. quot I said, quot Peace, and Allah's Mercy be on him (Gabriel ). You see what we do not see . quot (She was addressing Allah's Apostle). lt lt Sahih al-Bukhari 6249 "
You can tell when Putin is lying because his lips are moving.
"A prisoner exchange and a ceasefire, even if short, is better than nothing. Could this be the start of something better?"
"No ceasefire, just another one of Putin's countless lies."
Putin words are untrustworthy and cruel
Happy Easter from lover boy.
Zelenskyy is a disaster of a president
but Ukraine is winning
Ukraine Zionist terrorist insist on attackung
You believe putin really going to honor the cease fire. Yeah right
You didn't say anything about quot attacks are ongoing quot . Fix your title.
Zelenskyy is just in it for the money
Nazis are not Christians
This pr stunt to boost Putin ratings
Embolden Putin? What in the world does that mean? More warmongering Russophobia.
I hope both find out an way tô peace.
"Only reason Putin declared a truce was to punk Trump. I wonder who's going to realize he's getting played first, Trump or his followers? Best move for Trump is to just announce if Putin doesn't want peace then Trump is going to give Ukraine anything, and as much as of said anything, they want. Immediately. But! Alas he won't because he doesn't have the intelligence or intestinal fortitude. quot I going to have to pass on peace in Ukraine because my bone spurs are acting up again. quot"
"Ukraine, you are unbelievable, so strong"
"Beneath Hiroshima’s image of peace lies a covert war: state crimes, neuro-weapons, religious surveillance, virus research with RIKEN, and mind control tech. This is not fiction.”"
"Pay attention much do you, Russia began attacking shortly after this was done, It's just because trump was pulling out of the ceasefire deal How about you try filming the aftermath of russian attacks on Ukraine"
"President Trump is correct. Unnecessary War It 's not about Russia invading. It is about AZOV ethnically cleansing Ukrainians for speaking a different dialect of their common Russian language. Unnecessary War Merkel worked out a solution for peace, but Johnson and Biden bribed the little man to continue to push for war. I hope Putin have the courage to avail himself of the opportunity for peace offered by the President. This is an unnecessary War. May God never forgive those that pushed the world to the brink of a nuclear war. Namely: Johnson and Sunak, Scholtz, Biden and Blinken and Macron."
"Guess what trump you didn’t end that war , those two rational men did .."
"Understandable, Ukraine liked it better when it had undivided privilege to manipulate"
Concede to Russian demands for no NATO in Ukraine. No US or Western military in Ukraine. The rest is negotiable.
Russia never keeps its word. It broke all the previous treaties with Ukraine.
Nevet trust Russian terrorist war criminal putin
In Sha Allah Russia 🇷🇺 Will Be Victorious
Free Gaza! Salam alaikum.
Russia is feacting in advance on an Ukrainian reaction in advance. Putin never wanted real peace.
"the russian soldiers coloured many their eggs at friday on UA soil, so now they decided to eat others russians eggs on sunday, so that's why is ceasefire, to busy to eat others russians coloured eggs."
"Shoes of oir man sits in place of european leaders ,, Theres no abovv the upper body of qatar time zone"

"Russia's armament is no worse than America's, some even better, and Russia is advancing without a ceasefire, despite the fact that Europe and Binden gave more armament. America is the top 1 country in the world and Europe, could not overcome Russia, that's the alliance called NATO. Oh I remember NATO, those soldiers when they bombed Yugoslavia put Easter greetings on the missiles, how can such European countries still believe in God, just blasphemy and that's it, there is no God in Europe and there will be no God and it doesn't matter if your Macron prays! And for stupid bots Russia had no plans to occupy all of Ukraine to invest in it is a complete nonsense, what is the point if Ukraine sucks anyway? For 30 years it has had no development unlike Russia, well now Ukraine is stealing even more thanks to Europe and America (Thank you)"
"Ukraine must' and A must remain and its partners Ukraine MUST keep arm's and supplies-in order to fight and protect itself and people, 'PLEASE quot Ukraine partners must keep an eye out for this ceases fire, God bless Ukraine."

"The whole world knows that this is the West: Europe, Britain and the United States are waging a proxy war against Russia at the hands of Ukraine. Ukraine is like a private military company in the hands of the West! The war will end the day the West stops this war."
I tend to believe the Russians a lot more than i believe the comedian or his warmongering european puppeteers.
Killing Ukrainians all the Easter week now putin pretends to be a quot good Christian quot who could believe him
Way to go Putin. It's a start
"I've seen this today, Saturday. Also have seen Ukraine pointing out they haven't ceased firing yet... It also isn't Sunday yet, therefore not Easter, so... Sorry to say, but the truce isn't in effect at the moment. In fact it won't be for at least a few more hours. But keep in mind, Easter ends at midnight, and nothing is stopping them, either of them, from planning a surprise attack."
russia initiated easter truce. trump said if the peace deal is not productive then US will withdraw from the peace negotiations. as a result peace deal became corrupted and conflict reignited.
Only idiots listen to Putin.
You report the prisoner swap but not the body swap ?? 909 Ukrainians bodies and 41 Russian bodies........says something about the casualty rate between the two sides doesn't it.
Ukraine repeatedly broke the 30 day limited ceasefire. Report it correctly Al Jazeera.
Somebody please send Putin a special Easter egg.
Putine just needs some free time to put his troops in place. Beware.
I respect Trump and putin for their Christian values
"Maybe Boris Johnson, Liz Tras, Sunak or Keir Starmer, Macron or Merz wanted peace, sought peace in Ukraine and declared a truce?"
We Africans really enjoy Western misinformation and propaganda. it's refreshing only clowns at this stage. I believe this kind of misinformation comes from Western news channels
Humans always have something to say
The West has turned corrupt Ukraine into a PMC to ram the Russian Federation.
Russia though to have this war finished in 3 days and here we are 3 years later.
The reality is that Russia implemented the cease fire at 6 pm real time ⏲️ One good 👍 step
Al BBCeera must have been bought by The Sun. What a toilet of a propaganda channel.
Setting the stage for a false flag opperation.
Are you guys watching this combat footage? This war is insane
I love Trump and Putin
Easter's Ceasefire bridge ...Putin Say
Western shame on yourself look at him and look at netanyahu terrorist
Aljazeera on Israel/Gaza VS Aljazeera on Russia /Ukraine.
Please give peace a chance and save Ukrainians and Russians lives. 
She's spreading falsehood. This is not the first time there has been a ceasefire declaration by Putin. She's either lying straightfaced or dumb
russia shall .n uu ke ukr
this is token by putin to appese trump
"According to Al Jazeera Putin is afraid of Trump! LOL! Dear Al Jazeera, you are a propaganda mouthpiece of the west, except for Gaza where you don't have a choice!"
I here this is a sign that Putin is fearing Trump and he is trying to buy time. Is this reporter from Kyv real to himself
Why should Russia buy time. Who will benefit from ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine ¿
If Putin was sencire then why not impliment the Afganistan solution? (JUST LEAVE)
V.Putin is not innocent either. Many civiliians blccd on his hands .. In Ukraine.. In Syria...In Libiya .
"If Ukraine sees this as Putin trying to buy time, then they should keep on fighting and should not complain if it get hit hard. Nonsense!!"
Putin is as bad as Sinwar. Agressorrs act the same.
RUssia's PutInWithout title.. Ok Qatars Aj
"Trump should give Alaska instead of Crimea to Putin, and everything will be fine"
The pro Ukraine warmongering fanatics are so obnoxious. Bloodthirsty fools.
total BS!!... the nietkranians were bombing the Russian Ukranian people long before Russia steeped in with the Special Military Operation to protect its people.
"If they are not tired of the fighting, then let them continue with their foolishness, Trump says, which is exactly right."
"Ukraine surrender while you still can, you were NEVER WINNING, YOU WILL NEVER WIN THE WAR WITH RUSSIA. What are people smoking to think UKRAINE can win Vs RUSSIA?? MATTEO is delusional to think Ukraine can win. Just drop NATO and you will live, it's really that simple"
Hitler also never believed that he is losing.
Europe may buy air defense systems from the US for Ukraine.
"Putin the Demon will not run out of people anytime soon, because there are hundreds of thousands of people in Russia who want to earn enough money for a two-room apartment in a contract army in 1 year of war"
We need to ask Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky how to win this war
"Trump walk away from Ukraine, he dont walk away from Putler"
"If the US stops military aid and intelligence services, the war and killing will stop immediately. Zelensky is just a war entrepreneur, a liar without credibility, who wants to be an entrepreneur forever."
Trump the Dealmaker is running out of Lies and EXCUSES NOT ENDING. THE WAR AND HIS ECONOMIC FAILURE!
Is Ukraine making a new rare mineral deal with the USA to get funding? If not then are they getting bigger loans from some European countries to fund the war? If not then Russia will win and the peace deal will be much worse than the previous ones.
I will tell you mr trump. You are a lier and a very good one. You are definitely not a decent person. I also think that you are insane.
This panel is beyond delusional lol
Trump doesn't want to deal with anything that's too hard for his feeble brain. He barely put any effort into resolving the war issue and is already giving up? What a fool. Either that or Putin threatened to release whatever it is he's holding over Trump's head to make Trump so docile when it comes to Russia...
Trumpler will never admit russia started this war.
"You’ll never see a John Mearsheimer, a Jeffrey Sachs, a Larry Johnson or Lawrence Wilkerson on Al Jazeera coverage of the conflict in Ukraine. Wouldn’t want the facts to get in the way of their manufactured media narrative"
"Their concerns about how unless Russia is stopped, it's going to give signals to other autocrats and leaders that it's acceptable to push and expand borders by force is hypocritical. We already know one state, Izrael, who has done exactly that for decades, and no one has ever bothered to call that out. To say that Ukraine is the line that keeps such a thing from happening is nonsense."
"This war is not ours blame Zelensky for choosing war instead of signing the peace agreement in Istanbul, Turkey"
Don’t trust the Americans. Europe and its allies like canada need to figure out how to help Ukraine beat Russia without the US.
"Trump is a big fool with signs of early dementia syndrome, but now many Republicans are regretting having him as president, if not all of the USA. How, for God's sake, if he is not experiencing early dementia syndrome, can a normal person say that Zelensky started the war with Ukraine and Russia?"
"Should look into the nuclear non proliferation treaty and the agreement signed between US, Russia and Ukraine. See what value the word of the US and Russia has."
Trump is such a total and complete sham!
So the League of Nations haven't stopped history?
Trump you're the president WRIGHT.then Stop the wars now Or you fail
"I find President Macron`s actions more than strange. My own firm personal opinion is that all European leaders, including President Macron, should support President Trump`s strategies he is using both for Europe and for the Middle East, instead of playing against him and his strategies because of their own shady personal reasons. Why would President Trump want to have President Macron, that frog legged lame duck, or Ursula von der Leyen, another pompous failure, with him when negotiating with President Putin about Ukraine? President Trump`s decision not to include any European leaders in his talks with President Putin at this stage was 100% right in my opinion. President Macron is a so-called lame duck president. His second and last five years term as the French president ends already in 2027. He was born in December 1977, so he is still a young man when his second term ends. I strongly suspect that he is playing his shady political games to be able to get some high position from some international organization as soon as possible after his presidency ends . President Macron also claims that the so-called two state solution is the only solution. That too is total BS in my opinion. If it would be a solution, it would have been that already long ago. France 24 English asked if President Macron can bolster Egypt's plan for Gaza. I would rather ask why President Macron is playing so actively against the plans the US is using for Europe and for the Middle East. Qatari money is speaking when President Macron opens his mouth about something. There must be personal reasons behind that. Why would he otherwise repeat Qatari leaders Iran-friendly policies for the Middle East month after month? President Macron would also like to be rich and Qatari leaders could help him to become rich, if he does what they tell him to do in the international arena. UN Secretary General António Guterres ran unopposed in 2021 and he was re-selected unanimously by the Security Council. The current term of the Secretary-General is five years. This is already Antonio Guterre`s second and last term as the leader of the UN. I strongly suspect that President Macron is trying to become the next UN Secretary General and that is why he is acting in a way that would give him support first of all from quot Iran-friendly quot China. If China would back him for the next UN Secretary General, so would also Russia and the BRICS countries. I don`t like President Macron, at all. He acts as if he would be the reincarnation of Louis XIV. He is a self-important poseur with much too pompous manners. He also has a very serious mother complex. Just look at his wife and you get what I mean."
Time for America to get out.
"Al Jazeera is on point when it comes to Palestine, but it's a shame when it comes to Russia - Ukraine. Why is it normalized that people who are not Russian or in Russia, are allowed to tell us quot what Putin or Russia wants quot ? If I want to know what Russia wants or thinks, I listen to the Russian foreign minister 🚶🏿‍♂️‍➡️"
The Trump team has shown total incompetence in negotiating. They are also totally biased towards Russian propoganda and talking points. Trump is not frustrated - he is just trying to find a way of saving face by blaming it on someone else. The both-siderism is pathetic - also on this chanel - Russia invaded a peaceful sovereign country. Ukraine has just tried to defend itself.
If roles were opposite and Ukraine has enough nukes to end the world and Russia does not then US would pressure Russia not Ukraine
"Al Jazeera is my Number 1 source of sober minded, unbiased, well analyzed and neutral source of infornstion. The Russia Ukraine war is a message to anyone who makes a promise that they have got to keep it. Or else, it will go down the same Russia Ukraine way"
"CORRECTING YOU ,UKRAINE IS ACTUALLY WINNING ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN OVER ALL KILLS AND INJURIES ,,80% MORE RUSSIANS FALL MORE THAN UKRAINIANS TO THEIR DEATH !! RUSSIA TAKES A FEW VILLAGES OVER THREE YEARS OF MEAT WAVES ,,WAS IT WORTH IT? no WAY!! PUTIN CARES LESS ,HE THINKS THE TERRORIZING WITH BIG MISSILE STRIKES IS HIS BEST WAY TO MAKE UKRAINIANS FLEE THEIR LAND AND BREAK UKRAINE ECONOMY AND SCARE THEM INTO A SURRENDER,,,NEVER !! UKRAINE IS A MUSCH BETTER ARMY ......ONE HOOK ONE WORM CAN CATCH A SHARK ,,COMPARED TO PUTINS MILLIONS OF MINNOWS ATTACKING A SHARK! AND THE BEST FISHERMAN ,,ZELENSKY!))"
"Trump was elected to protect democracy like every other president, sad to say he likes autocratic leaders"
"The misinformation coming from the Western media houses about this war has been interesting to listen to, Aljazeera isn't left out. How can you say Europe is making efforts to end the war? Only a f00l which make such an untrue statement. Aljazeera, you should do better!!!!"
"No one asked Trump quot to broker peace in Ukraine. quot No one benefited from his naive, half-hearted quot efforts quot . This is another Trump's failure for which he is blaming others - surprise, surprise."
"Trump and Putin are gangsters or, at best, pale imitations of President Zelenskyy, who has shown extraordinary resilience and leadership by remaining in Kyiv and rallying both the Ukrainian people and international support during Russia’s full-scale invasion. It would be hard to find a better or more capable leader. Standing with Ukraine is standing up for humanity."
"Why don't you understand simple calculus?Trump wants to delay peace deal because he wants to Russia to occupy more territories.Since Trump took office, Ukrainian got blow upon blow because the USA changed its position on Ukrainian.Trump is in collusion with Putin."
"Mattia you just do not get it or just wants to mis-understood. Putin and Russia has achieved it goal and how to get into the conclusion and it could be done today if Zelenskyy says no to NATO and then the war will stop. 1000 Russia soldiers died a per day thus they have Chinese and Norh Korea soldiers there, 1000 per day death. And quot win-win over here quot well it is not win-win over there for Iraq and Afghanistan. Win Iraq and Win Afghanistan professor Donald what have you been drinking. Russia causes the war have you read the Provoked, US threats Russia through Ukraine. Like Trump is doing with Iran to nuke them this is win-win. Trump does not care about win-win but for himself to make history with nuke. Trump wants to be in history time big. professor donald you are in self-deception with never here of win-win."
"The moment Trump started carving out exceptions to his own tariffs, he already lost the war. Now he’s just the world’s biggest loser."
"Well it is about time that Trump acknowledged that he was never going to end the Russia-Ukraine war within a day of entering office. What a clown, what a loser!"
Trump will make the world safer❤
He is pathological liar.He is eyeing on Ukrainian minerals.He is cruel to core that he doesn't value human lives. Thousand soldiers are being killed from both sides.He doesn't give a hoot about them.
Kaliningrad is closer to Berlin than Kiev to Moscow!
"Does no body see that the war was only based only on NATO membership, !! That ship has sailed, so many lost lives lost for nothing!. Just watched , your pundits.. it’s like they never watched followed the conflict unfolding. Too many tards !"
Mattia has absolutely no idea
"Ukraine needs to cede the four Oblasts and obviously Crimea, or the war will not stop and the Russians will probably take everything up to the Dneiper and Kharkov and Odessa. If the Ukrainians had lived up to the Minsk agreements in 2014/15 and then the Istanbul agreement in April of 2022 and not listened to the West they would have lost far less territory . The West is responsible for this conflict. Al Jazeera and the rest of mainstream Western media propaganda report it incorrectly."
"Think tank guys are either idiots or NeoCon propagandists… prob both. Makes for nice cushy career though. It’s a shame the Qatari gov’t sees fit to disseminate this paper thin, debunked narrative about Russian weakness, deviousness amp depravity, but not surprising. Prob synced with US deep state media budget, previously dispersed by USAID."
Hahaha...trump's pride for peace within 24 hours and now abandons peace talks...he eats his own words...hehehe...that's the president of a powerful nation....hehehe again...
"Those dim wits that think Ukraine is losing should ask themselves why the world's second largest army has lost 900k young men and still can't win the 3 day military special operation after 3 plus years. Go figure, we all know Russia amp Putin are finished....not long now ..👍"
Why refuse the world to ask ukraine to stay away from nato. Would the US accept a Russian militair base in Mexico or Cuba? Why try to press Russia to accept it near their border?
Trump is a criminal and lies like Putin and they are convicted criminals and they should definitely be impeached and out of power and the world should definitely not trust him.
"Hey, Donny! What's the problem? Why are you making so much fuss about this war, which you say, that it is not your war?? If Zelensky doesn't want to accept Putin terms and conditions, and Putin refuses to accept Zelensky's terms, then, isn't it clear enough to you, that both of them want to continue fighting, an resolve this problem on the battlefield? Again, what problem you have with this?? Why don't you just walk away and let them fight it out?? (Unless it IS your war)."
"Russia has less territory now than it had 3 yrs ago! Russia has not taken one large town or city in Ukraine. Russia has failed in its objective to take the entire country of Ukraine. Russia has had over 900,000 casualties so far, and counting. The Russian army has been totally humiliated on the world stage. Ukraine will remain a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Russia should just go home and cry"
Trump is a beau Sheller
Why you guys are not in fever of solving this catastrophe by negotiating and solve the problems I don't know
"Trump is a coward. He threatened Ukraine who are the victims! He warned Ukraine to agree to a 30 day ceasefire. Ukraine then chose to agree to a full unconditional ceasefire on the 11th of March. But Russia chose to continue the war instead . Trump needs to get serious with the aggressor, not the victim."
"If Ukraine is not losing, I don't know what losing looks like to you"
"Panel of dreamers, Russia weak, Ukraine can win, just with a little push. Boringly dangerous propagandists"
Trump proves he doesn't know how to negotiate! He went into it AFTER sacrifying Krim and Ukraine member ship.with Nato... Beacuse he wanted Ukraine weak! He is too fond of Putin and I dispise him for that!
quot The US president's patience is running thin. quot It would be funny if it weren't so sad how people speak about him as if he was anything but a phony.
"You people want Trump to go to war for a senseless fight so you can sit back here and criticise him for it as well. No, America has bigger priorities now and stopping imminent enrichment of uranium in the Middle East is one. So, Russia or Ukraine is a waste of time or distraction and some of you would want Trump to be drowned in it while this rogue enrichment of uranium speedily progresses. No, you cannot tell Trump where to give attention. Sorry...."
"We , Russians do not care what mr.Trump is about. Special militarily operation has its goals. So far , if special operation did not achieved its goals war will continue..."
Russia wants Ukraine to be a Russian autonomous region. You're Welcome.
"The orange blob is at it again lies, lies and more lies the most insane president the US has ever had"
And as far as I'm concerned the American people want to be in a little f* *** bottle then go ahead
As far as I'm concerned Trump better get off as high horse and start putting a little effort into stopping Putin because when it comes to China and the United States I guess you better start constricting your own people because nobody else is going to come and help you Donald Trump through the Americans under the bus plus other countries
Trump and the confederacy are THE horrible people.
Why would Russia want a ceasefire when there winning the war.
Im loosing my MIND over Trumps incompetence.......weak leadership towards Putin 😤
"I follow Al Jazeera. I trust your journalism, particularly when it comes to Gaza. But when you cover Russian invasion of Ukraine, I find it disappointing. Biased in Russia's favour., even when clearly Russia invaded just tand only o expand their lands. For example, Ukraine did not break the ceasefire agreement, it was Russia bombing a Ukranian train station because they claimed it was an quot energy infrastructure quot not quot an energy AND infraestracture quot ceasefire"
Putin declared easter ceasefire. Whatever that means.
Ukraine is going to be defeated even with US help
Wasn't Trump the one that promised to end this war in one day? Maybe that was Iran? Greenland? Gaza?
"Ceasefire proposal is a crucial one. Most of the people want to see a peace talks and peace solutions of these problems. Russia, Moscow has a single flag. No one can neglect the flag of Russia, Moscow in another country, legally in this time. The territory of this country [ Ukraina, Kyiv. ] allowed by 190 countries around the world and that country [ Ukraina, Kyiv. ] recognized by the United Nations and othe international organizations."
Gestapo Trump forgot his “day one he will end the Ukrainian war”…it’s incredible his MAGA base voted this corrupt dictator when it’s right in front of their eyes fooling them. And he blames everyone for his own screwed ups.
"US have no say in Ukrainian conflict. None. Zilch, Nada."
"Trump threatens this , and that His middle name should be and is quot THREATENS quot ."
"Lol. Trump will never abandon efforts to facilitate Ukraine' capitulation to Putin. Not going to happen for as long as the orange fraudster is alive, but even beyond since a good chunk of maga republican establishment is in Putin' pocket.😮"
Better never make false promises and stay humble within one's limits instead of nourishing one's hubris.
Russians went to war to keep NATO out of Ukraine and you think now they will let them in as a peace keepers you have to be a brainless idiot to agree to that
I think US will find that their next conflict will have former allies watching from the side. It is insane to commit to any cooperation with a country that could turn on you at any time like a rabid animal. 🤷‍♂
"It seems Zeliensky is the most manipulative one in this war. He was supposed to sign the deal with Trump. But when he got to the Oval Office, he threatened the USAs security buy saying the the big ocean between the USA and Europe would not save the US. Trump knows people. He doesn't trust Zeliensky."
He didn't start conflict it's up to warin party whether to continue or stop war either way America have nothing to lose or gain
The guest is spewing unsubstantiated foolishness without challenge. Nothing he said was accurate.
"Weak president could not stop Putin, now looking way out of this. But, whole world will remember this embarrisment forever."
Someone must be brain dead to really think Ukraine is not losing this war😮
GET OUT FROM UKRAINE NETANYAHUY'S GENOCIDAL TEAM CLOUD TERRORISTS PUTINOID CRIMEA IS UKRAINE UKRAINE IS EUROPE
"Feeling sorry for Americans, they don’t have much luck with their old fart presidents"
"Trump's quot patience is running thin quot that Zelensky is slow to hand over Ukraine's wealth. Trump doesn't give two wits that people are dying, that a country is being destroyed. He doesn't WANT to stop the conflict. He's using the conflict to coerce Zelensky into handing over Ukraine's wealth."
"pathetic to put this Russian shill on. hilarious for Al Jazeera, where is the quality journalism, i have gotten used to"
Trump said a day . 100 days on ???
American administration took this action on their own expecting easy outcome. I believe their withdrawal from the peace talk was expected but should not be deemed as earth shuttering negative. Their superiority is only diminishing and they are very distracted by many problems they have created on the international landscape..
Could it be that the Trump administration now has a more realistic view of the state of the war and what is feasible in the next 1 year and decided it is simply not worth it to keep doing what the west has been doing?
"Ofcourse, trump is now saving himself because he could not stop the conflict, LOL"

Let’s talk about how Qatar proposes to mediate Israel and hxmxs despite housing hxmxs members and funding their weaponry
"A truce he broke, as expected."
Good news. But Ukraine may not follow Russia took many good decisions so far and Ukraine neglected.
Your service I like it
PUTIN RAN OUT OF BULLETS FROM JHINA LOLO I OL
Come on. stop send this news. Instead go there and tjek yourself as a news channel. you know it is. not true.
Putin is always lying.
Reminds me of the homeless crisis in San Fran when China came to town. If you can stop it temporarily you can do it permanently.
I have asked for tattoos… Trump delivered. Senator can go back to El Salvador and prove the tattoos are fake or STFU
CIA and Extremists are operating in that war. in both armies.
Putin needs a break to regroup and resupply for spring invasion. Only idiots believe in the Axis of Evils.
The suffering this man has brought to the world is unforgivable.
Declaring a ceasefire? You just know Putin is about to start another offensive.
The West are saying Russia has taken a Easter ceasefire but other news sources other than Western media are saying Russia are going to war with NATO lol..My guess is Russia will attack NATO giving the west fuel to spread more propaganda
Trump Putin ect are predictable they all float over old crack houses around a school that built a gym I think it was the flooring with a basketball court in 1991 (last shadow fall incident). Nothing has gone out of synchronisation globally since from that school location. When I normally show people they freak the fk out.
How kind of him. Maybe he could stop the invasion as well
Thank you president Putin much respect to you .
"So how come his missiles hit Good Friday shoppers in a civilian area then??? Putler does NOT have a heart, his troops are simply taking a beating and are retreating!!!"
Putin he is honest president
Ukraine should have talked Moscow than talking to trump he is business man who want to exploit Ukraine thank God that that Ukrainian president never signed that deal Russia and Ukraine are one they can understand each other without trump
Russia is more humane than is rael will ever be. DON quot T trust Ukraine to abide the short ceasefire !!
"russians were beaten last days,, their cannon fodder assaults on bikes and cycles were defeated, so they need a pause very much"
"Right now, when Russia has said that a ceasefire would prevail, Russia is sending its missiles and drones just as if there is no ceasefire."
What a no news.. as if one day without fighting changes anything
"No he did not order a cease fire, it was full of ifs and butts as usual to misslead and confuse. He is on the way out. A lying murderer"
The real man Boss Man Mr putin love you respect you and support you in whatever you do. The real president and a fantastic intelligent leader. Love and respects all the way from London
"Putin could just declare peace not just a ceasefire, say his 'Special Military Operation' was a success take his toys and go home."
I had waited for this time happen in Palestine and Gaza from the IDF but..... It seems no hope
They already broke the truce
"ceasefire doesnt mean to end war, it means break time"
Little Boots has spoken.
All twisted. Are you real reporters or you reading tick-tock
Me waiting for Stephen Colbert to joke about this...oh and that school shooter that when he was a kid his mom said she was taking him to Disney Land and then ended up taking him to Norway...
President Putin is a good hearted man but others don't understand him otherwise most Russian generals had wanted to bomb Ukraine once and eliminate it on the map but Putin refused
So Russia declared unilatterally capitulation?
What a hypocrite. Suddenly become all Christian. Does he think by declaring this ceasefire that God will forgive him for all the blood on his hands? No chance
"Don't trust Putin, Netanyahu amp Trump, once they move their people into new positions they break truces without notice."
Fake Ukraines foreign prime minister said “he can’t be trusted”
How can you have a ceasefire declared by only one side?
War now hands on putin's
"returning safely a third time to an unconfirmed miracle has already occurred or more confused recognition of this. Maybe their is more to this than the divine , eternal conflict and shared remorse and awful organisation."
UKRAINE should NOT heed this message. PUTIN is NOT their god!
Timing or is Ukraine understanding something ?
"As a Christian sovereign as he claims, he can't do otherwise."
I guarantee you Ukraine should take this ceasefire or else they would be the ones not wanting peace.
"He's such a good diplomat! I thought they were all extinct, supplanted by a merry con bombast and broken oaths."
Fell to Trump's pressure
Ukraine broke it already
That's because his troops have just mutinied in Krasnodar.
Doubt he will keep his words
Wow. This is amazing news. Trump wanted a ceasefire by Easter but 2 day ceasefire is too short. Hopefully it leads to permanent ceasefire. The chance for a ceasefire is much better this year with Trump admin wanting to end the war.
I didn't realize Christianity is alive amp well in Russia 
The audacity of this man to declare a ceasefire to a war he himself started
"Maybe he wants to light the candles with a roket in his generous mind,"
Vladimir Putin 
Long live Putin
"No chance, this is Poo Tin playing the game, unless Ukraine wants this, give them a few drones."
"Putin is magnanimous. This isn't the first time he has offered peace. Everyone seems to forget the Russian column that turned around without entering Kiev. This war would have been over, no, never would have started without NATO agitators."
Trump will take credit
Only because Ukraine are just starting to take the initiative on the frontline
Wow how holy of them! It’s a shame Christian’s don’t have the same compassion for Gaza.
Murderer promises to take a break... wow..
How come can get ceasefires but not T?
St. Vladimir you are too kind!
How can you violate a truce you didn’t agree to?
"Oh, soo compassionate and religious man, yes, thank you Putin, no children will die during two days, you can wait some hours to get your young blood dose. You are a saint. Spassiba very much."
Long live Mr Putin 
Literally only because it’s to his military advantage to have a few days ceasefire and it will make it look like he wants peace/ make Trump see him as more committed to peace. Only morons can’t see straight through this.
Don't trust putin
Putin is more believable than Bibi and His puppet Trump 🤌🏽
Putin in charge of war in Ukraine not America
Vladimir Putin is a good man. President Trump is a better man. Zelensky too bad he’s the odd man out… I would like to see Russia and America as allies someday.
Remember that whatever putler does is opposite of reality. We've seen his quot cease fires quot . Now he'll say Ukraine violated it.
Unnecessary war .
Genocidal dictator declares a ceasefire? How generous.
God bless Putin and the Russian federation!🇷🇺
"ceasefire deals always get broken after a few minutes or few hours when its active lol, so whats the point lol"
A surprisingly decent thing from him. I don't trust him to keep his word though.
Would be wonderful but Ukraine never respected any ceasefire.
Putin says a lot of things 
Trump said the war would be over in 24 hours! Guess not huh?
"That is very sudden. It's almost certain that Ukraine will take advantage of it, and then Putin will say quot see they don't want ceasefire quot and Trump will agree, giving him an excuse to pull out and say quot They don't actually want the war to end, so we're out quot ."
To let Ukraines ocuppy the trenches and weapons thats absurd the  Russian will resume war after Monday
quot Correction. No cease-fire. It's a special military suspension. quot Putin
saint russians
Wow what a nice guy
So that means no map update tonight
Should be Easter every day!!!
Putin has all the cards!
I do not believe it. They do not hold their promises.
"Only because it suits Kaputin. Don't buy it, Ukraine."
Btw. Putin is NOT A GENIOUS orange
"Of course it couldn't possibly be because Ukraine has just knocked out a couple of supply routes, and Putin wants the opportunity to repair them without being attacked."
And you all believe Putin????? he cannot be trusted
You better take it zelensky. Stop sacrificing young Ukrainian people's. Don't try to act like a tough guy Mr clownsky
putin the dictator of dictators!
Want to acknowledge Jesus ? Turn that 2 day truce into a ever lasting peace.
I love Putin
Yeah few days will be blessed Not all days And live few days And the rest Have peace And become ready for dog game
Russia has been already retaliating every day…!
What a good guy 
"Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral Easter ceasefire in Ukraine, ordering his forces to end hostilities at 6 p.m. Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday until the end of Sunday."
Ukraine must not be two trusting from an reliable man who said he has intention to invade Ukraine but did just that through tricks
"Among the most excellent of your days is Friday so invoke many blessings on me on that day, for your blessing will be submitted to me. lt lt Sunan Abi Dawud 1531 "
"Prolong it to forever, if you are brotherly nations then stop the bloodshed with this oppurtunity."
"The Prophet said, quot Allah loves sneezing  but dislikes yawning  so if anyone of you sneezes and then praises Allah, every Muslim who hears him (praising Allah) has to say Tashmit to him. lt lt Sahih al-Bukhari 6226 "
Is that just Russia time zone or is it going to ripple around the world Time zone?
"Putin plz take muslim army of Pakistan and Bangladesh, and u will see ukrain in Russia in week❤❤"
Oh so Putin bombs civilians on Palm Sunday and calls for peace on Good Friday. Like every other Russian ‘“promise” it’s garbage
Trusting 🇷🇺
Watch Trump make this sound like it was his idea.
Russia's Putin ! NO title.. Is there any Putin u know?
"Not only is he losing the trade war with China, he’s also losing his mind, that’s if he hasn’t lost it already "
🇺🇸 will not allow 🇺🇦 to follow suit!
Peace on earth please . Slava earth
Promises from a pathological liar aren't usually worth much.
“Ceasefire” sure Vald.
It's a late April fools joke. Russia being the fools. Remember they lie always.
When are you going to show us the renewed anti-hxmxs protests in Gaza? “All hxmxs are trash” is what they’re shouting
Oh dear! Ukraine will have to change the Date of Easter now...
Putin calls a truce for the Easter holiday while Netanyahu not only failed to respect Ramadan but also failed to comply with the ceasefire.
"I drank a beer , today ended up in a planter box yelling at the sky."
Atleast russia have some humanity unlike america and israel.
"Its still meaningless, he just wanted to make headlines in western media"
"Monarchy country creates world all prblms and Qatar prince was monster, he makes disaster middle region nd asia region all countrys by his al jazeera newspaper or so call media"
How tall is Putin? Or is the King just that tall??
How about helping Palestinian not be massacred
"Qatari says, Putin, Go Hug yourself, Son of the Crimea Bridge...."
They're celebrating the demise of the us
All these Middle East leaders having meetings but not even saving their own Muslim brothers and sisters in Gaza what a joke lol
Now we can have some adult conversations as the children are out of the room!
Russia's Putin? Try America's Trump or israel's Yahoo.
The US is getting shown the door everywhere around this world.
Qatar and Malaysia are my favorite country love from India. May Allah bless and protect them
Qatar you lost the war against Israel your propaganda efforts were unsuccessful. Desperately looking for ally’s like turkey Syria Lebanon Russia Egypt didn’t succeed.
"Cuz we all know Syria take over was CIA coordinated using Qatar, Turkey and Israel."
Qatar alike hamas
Wow emir of Qatar is so handsome 
Ruasia need to return to Syria
I am sure two guys at the door are new.
when she said health care sector . My little brother thought it was sextor.....
Julia seems very happy today. I wonder why ?
"Masha Allah, revolution is near"
Support Russia  Love Palestinians Iran Yemen
Trump should learn some manners from the leaders of china and russia. All of them are far from innocent but unlike childish trump. they atleast now how to respect others and sustain diplomatic relationships
Is Qatar going to invade uae and saudi after this and call them nazis and threaten nuclear response after this meeting influenced by putin ?
Never forget what Putin did to Chechnya and Syria
WHAT ABOUT 'UMMEE JAMIL' WIFE OF ABU LAHAB WAR TACTICS AGAINST OUR PROPHET HAZRAT MOHAMMAD MOSTAFA (S.A) WHICH ARE STRICTLY FOLLOWED BY ISRAELIS THINKS TANK AND IDF AND WEST ALSO !!
All the best to Qatar Amir  and President Putin 
"Putin in trouble, help me Qatar"
Let the civilized world come together and liberate Palestine from colonialism. Anglo-American imperialism crumbling together with their zionist surrogates.
"I love what Putin has done for other countries,but the Arab countries are more concerned about,than Palestine, cowards"
Putin no arrogance or pride
Russia can help palastiens
"British mandate of Palestine 1921 and the Haganah forces killed and migrated thousands of Palestinian people to establish the Palestine occupation. YouTube, EZEKIEL 38 wars prophesied in the bible. Countries and communities destroyed for opposing the Palestine occupation. Somalia Sudan Libya Yemen Afghanistan Iraq Syria Lebanon Palestine Russia Rohingya Uighur Kashmir Kosovan Iran. Wars bankrupting the Western countries and killed millions of innocent people."
I am sure they will discuss human rights and world peace given their spotless track records...
Putin is a leader the world will remember for thousands of years to come. A real hero of our time. A man of morals and conviction.
CURSED RUSHAN NETANYAHUYS SCUM SHAME ON QATAR SHAME SHAME
"Every time before the next meeting of NATO defense ministers in Ramstein, where Zelensky will ask for money and weapons, another provocation with the death of people takes place in Ukraine. Ukraine is given money and weapons, and then Zelensky buys himself another castle, casino or diamond mines"
Putin kills Children and is a Terrorist.. Disgusting
"Rusia🇷🇺 must respect sovereignity territorial integrity of Ukraine (Crimea, Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, Luhansk), Georgia (Abkhazia amp South Ossetia). keep peace."
Why Ukraine Military attacked Russian civilians??? Blame Zelensky co'z he doesn't want peace!
make peace ya fools
Zelensky attacking russia repeatedly. Zelensky madness invited NATO EU countries in to war The karma god punishing Ukraine for Zelensky wrong doings. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE GOING TO DIE IF ZELENSKY DO NOT SURRENDER AND ACCEPT FAILURES
aljazera is prapoganda channel why clown joker zalinsky wants War shame on zalinsky shame on you byghrait
Parents forgot that the country is at war.
Same in. Gaza
"But I thought Zelensky said Israel has the right to defend itself? Knowing very well Israel occupies Palestine?? Does Russia have the absolute right to defend itself? Ukraine, be careful and watch what you say. Because it’ll definitely come hunting you back."
Russia targets only military base
Jews have money and christian have what?american are money collector shame on US and Israel
Let the successful comedian see difference between war and drama
The difference between life of Ukrainian while palastinians life mean nothing double standards hypocrisy of west
"IN 2022, UKRAINIAN MISSILES Flew INTO POLAND AND KILLED TWO POLES. UKRAINE TO THIS DAY CLAIMES THAT IT WAS RUSSIA BECAUSE IT WANTED NATO TROOPS TO JOIN THE WAR!!! NOW THEY ARE STILL MAKING A FALSE FLAG. DON'T FALL FORCE!! NASTY DIVISIONARY NATION, IN POLAND WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF THEM, VERY AGGRESSIVE, WILD BEHAVIOR AND A LARGE INCREASE IN GRAVE CRIMES."
whoever decided to have the nato officers meet in a residential neighbourhood has an evil mind and a vile soul
"Why so many families were staying in this city? Because Ukrainian men are banned from leaving Ukraine, and many women decide to stay with their husbands instead of looking for a better life alone"
Zelensky onces said quot misile speak for themselves quot sorry
"With Trump's implied approval, unfortunately"
this propaganda are you forget the kil of palestinine
Force with Force is retarded.
"Really??? So pathetic.Think of Gaza , think of Donetsk and Lugansk children, you hypocrites .Shame on you.. Think of children of Gaza..You, double standards journalists! You are disgusting!!!"
How many ukraine amry killed innocent russian why use not talk about that
What of Palestinians being killed? So u want us to feel sorry about this yet its happening everyday in gaza and no one talks about it.
Meanwhile the comedian dictator continue hiding inside Kyiv underground Bunkers
"Not any other,he is a criminal, I meant zelensky is."
Russia president needs to be held accountable for his actions on Ukraine country killing people's amp children.He needs to be removed as president in Russia amp sent to federal prison for criminal sprees he doing dirty on Ukraine country. we need a change for better world.
In 11 years that Ukraine has been bombing and killing civilians in Donbass not one report by Al Jazeera or any other Western media about that. Pathetic news outlet.
Remember the kids of Palestine 🇵🇸
those are media stories begging for western help
"Senseless Zelenskyy, Does he want Russia not to respond when he continues to throw missiles into Russia?"
Al Jazeera genuinity compromised . They are not focusing Palestine genocide but spreading poison news against Russia
"Remember the kids of palestine , why they are not taking actions against US amp Rascal(Israel)"
As long as Zelensky is there this will continue
So sad. But lets see if western media that ignored Israeli massacre of medics jumps on this.
Ukraine is a part of old Russia
"Show similar scenes from Dombas in 2023 and then there will be no propaganda for the naive. The Russians attacked the building where the military meeting was held, and since the Ukrainians placed this meeting in a residential area, it is clear what it was about. They made civilians into human shields! Show the restaurant where the meeting was held!"
russia has a right to defend itself
Permanent ceasefire now
Give Peace a Chance!
People actually support Russians invasion of Ukraine. Embarrassing

Zelensky is crazy...he already sold Ukraine out to the west
You never spoke of the war crimes Ukraine committed in kursk.
"Ukraine should stop having meetings in public places, we know that Western Military leaders were having a meeting there."
"Islam is against of killing children , old age people and women in wars."
This is War....is Zelenski's War ....in War is Civilian's Deaths.....but is Not Genocide....Genocide is Gaza's Genocide....Only
Why did Ukraine attack Belgorod?.
Where is a picture of the damaged restaurant?
Never allow an Israeli to lead a country
It's painful to lose a child.
This is what Israel has to deal with constantly. If only the P’s would stop terr attacks
"The symbolism in quot Ambitionz AZ a Ridah, quot as it relates to war, delves into deeper psychological and emotional dynamics, particularly envy and identity. The idea that quot they are jealous because deep inside they want to be you quot reveals how conflict can originate from a desire to possess or emulate what another holds like power, and resources. This envy often transforms into aggression, driven by the inability to reconcile admiration with resentment, underscoring the destructive effects of unresolved desires and insecurities."
"Putin should never be trusted. He omce begged clinton if he can join nato. After West led nato supplies Ukraine with arsenals which destroyed million of soldiers, he now begging US to get rid of tariff so it can do business with America... What a traitor he is and a treasonous leader of his country!!! Replace putin in anyway possible asap"
china just wants cheap oil
China talking about fair trade is laughable.
china -russia brings multiploar world
Only idiots listen to Pinocchio from Beijing. Your brain stopped functioning after too much FAKE IN CHINA ?

"Stealing US navy carrier diagrams, jet fighters diagram and copy US leading talks with other countries. Ashamed on China"

Every single Chinese spokesman of the last decade presents a one sided discourse with no self reflection or objective reasoning.
Putin needing to plea to his master
The world respects Russia China .BRICS is the future.
"Trump is an amateur., clueless man child."
Long live Iran /China/ and Russia
Russia and China r the only ones who can keep America from dominating and enslaving the world
Long Live Sino-Russian Strategic Partnership of Coordination 🇨🇳🇷🇺
US NATO is defeated in Ukraine. Their next move is Taiwan . China knows this. The US is run by globalist banksters. It's all about global control. Remember in 1929 they crashed the Wall St that led to US depression. That was planned . And this is being repeated in our times as the dollar is soon to lose global reserve currency status. .They are bringing the entire world economy with them esp these using dollars. History is repeating itself.
Trumps stupid ideas are pushing the world toward China. America losses
"all lies, both the chinese and the others, meanwhile wars go on and people get poorer"
The mistakes of our past should never prevent us from doing what is Right tomorrow. This IS world world three. …THIS is the righteous fight of our generation. The Chump administration wants America and Europe to collapse so that Putin and Xi never even have to worry about opposition. Then they might let DipshtDonny join dictator club if he begs hard enough.
No body really thinks Ukrains is at top of China' s agenda with Russia
"I said: Messenger of Allah, it has been narrated to me that you said: The prayer of a man in a sitting position is half of the prayer, whereas you are observing prayer sitting. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes, it is so, but I am not like anyone amongst you. lt lt Sahih Muslim 735a "
We stand with China and Russia - 22 was the year where USSR born !!!
the evil force of USA wants war and destruction in the world
The main agenda is to cut USA influence in the Asia continent.
China dependent on russia gas and oil and weapon system
Free USA
LA should become a state of China and break away from the usa
Forget the USA
China Russia and India together. That’s a team

"My sincerest condolences to the millions of palestinians who are merely being used as tools by cheenk corona land, russia and iran, who are fighting israel and the west to the last palestinian."
"This isn’t the Cold War. From China’s perspective, the Russian government and political ideology is just another Western of a long list of passing short lived dead end political systems. China can now stand on its own economically and militarily. Unlike Russia, they have been able to keep and expand their global political and economic influence. I.E. Russia needs them, more than China needs Russia. From their pov, China will simply out last them and Xi’s and his party’s influence on history will be remembered better than Putin’s or any other transitory Western nation’s administration."
Trump got problem with China because they strong a economically than US.
EU needs to be came more friendly with China.
Yet some idiots in EU are still hoping to get support from China regarding the war in Ukraine. China and Russia are good friends.
One telephone call of xi jinpin can stop this ukrain war. China is biggest trade partner of china and without chinese help they cannot survive.
"Rusia🇷🇺 must respect sovereignity territorial integrity of Ukraine (luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kherson, Crimea), Georgia (Abkhazia amp South Ossetia). Keep peace !"
If it's only for communist leaders I'm surprised Trump's not there
why don't West go to support East Germany against West Germany? California against USA? Texas against USA? New Mexico against USA? Catalonia against Spain? Scottland against England? Corscica against France? Western Queensland against Australia?
I don't have more confidence in how much both countries would be on the side of Iran if war emerged between the US and Iran
Russia is on ucraine China is on taiwa America is on green land Who is to stop the other
Amicable settlement preferring
We respect Russia and china .
"Europe needs to move fast. It's the only way to talk to the BRICS and the US. Trump blew it BIG time. Reck the relationship with their allies, now Russia has deepened ties with a fellow BRICS nation, China. No one will trust the US after this. The US is the world's last imperial power. Rise Europe."
"The main topic is de-dollarisation. Trump wants to please Putin, so he ended the de de-dollarisation. Russia is a major oil and gas exporter not using the dollar is a problem for the US because the US can't do to Putin what they did to Gadafi and Saddam. Putin will never end the de dollarisation no matter what Trump says or does."
NYTimes reported US and UK coalition war on Russia in Ukraine unsuccessful. The West keeps trying this since Napoleon.
2 imperalist satanic nations..2 illidimate leaders no to communisms..
We stand with Russia and china 🇷🇺🇨🇳
"This relationship is at least 100 years in the making eg “In bidding farewell to you, dear comrades, I wish to express the fervent hope that the day may soon dawn when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will greet, as a friend and ally, a strong and independent China and the two allies may together advance to victory in the great struggle for the liberation of the oppressed peoples of the world.” (Farewell letter to Soviet Russia by Sun Yat-sen, 1925)"
China can't do right in the eyes of the western media and vice versa
A nuclear response
Zelensky is a psycho sponsored by a senile. 5 days to the end of the world button move from this demon hands.
Russia should end the war they started immediately
Drones are not missiles.
Need a Oreshnik in Kiev asap.
Russia doesn t have to have a reason to bomb civilian infrastructure and killing civilians
Little Zionist Zelenskyy wants protection like Zionist Israel 🇮🇱.USA 🇺🇸 not your friend and you not member of AIPAC
Russia will respond in 100 fold! Or they have to take the puppet Zelensky war machine out of commission
"&quotRetaliation&quot? Are they kidding? They attacked Ukraine, then promise retaliation when Ukraine fights back? This is laughable."
hahahahahaha so russia will retaliate for ukraine retaliating for attacking and invading ukraine s territory
Soon Russia will know it economically to recover will take Russia to 2050
"When war criminals (Russia) struck Ukrainian energy infrastructures intentionally they called it Special Military Operations but when Ukraine retaliates and does the same, the orcs hypocritically called it terrorist attack."
Looks like the Russian warning to the West went unheeded.
It is war of Russia with dollars . Dollars national security and peace is war in other countries for energy?
The world is on fire pp save your self
So all those those missiles were shot down? I guess a lot of Ivans were smoking in places where they shouldn t be smoking then
"yes, of course they will retaliate. they might even invade! oh wait..."
"A lot of the people here are just delusional or ignorant, Russia can make Ukraine disappear but they didn t do it because they know their enemy is not the Ukrainians but the West who are only using them to fight their proxy war."
You ever notice the western media only report when Ukraine does a big PR stunt yet when its armies are encircled and defeated you dont hear a peep out of them.
This is a proxy war.ukraine does no have the technology to attack russia in this way. This is the last attack of the blinken ziehls administration against russia
You shot all the missiles and drones but I am seeing fire
The Russians could take all Ukraine if they really wanted to because they re only using 10% of their powers.
The west are silent now let Russia response and see the hypocrisy in those countries
"Al Jazeera is a banned media. More and more countries are bans this media who supports terror in Syria, etc."
"Putin thought he was the great strategist, that he was smart, but he is Russia’s cancer tumor. He is responsible for this war, the huge loss of lives. He has drained Russia’ financial reserves, brought Sweden and Finland is to NATO. Ruined his own country’s arms export and maybe gas and petroleum exports as well. Putin is a nothing more, than a small coward."
"All ballistic missiles are supersonic, what is the guy talking about?"
"God help Ukraine they will need it now, this rubbish needs to stop now, peace is the only option."
No one is afraid of Russias threats any more.
"GOD bless Russia,Glory to Russia in jesus mighty name Amen??,"
"The cause and foundation of the problem is italy and France Paris,Rome,Napolitano,Napoli,America, Rome,Taranto,Torino,Sardegna,??"
"This is not a war between Ukraine and Russia, but the ones and only war mongers US and EU. Ukraine being the kitchen and Ukrainians the firewood"
Russia retaliate zelenski cry Russia acting like animal
"Russia says its OK for them to attack Ukraine, but not for Ukraine to hit Russia..... what planet are they on???"
Russia is playing with Ukraine
Biden will make sure to have clear mess before Trump Sworn in
NATO - Russia War!
Donald will be busy in LA ... Russia will double up
Prepare for oreshnik
I feel so sorry for Ukraine now just being a puppet in this war.
What a clown
Please stop war and make peace
Very difficult to defend oil and chemical facility.
"Retaliation?? What are they going to do, Invade!"
"All pro Russian comments are coming from poor under developed countries , is it just a coincidence ..??"
When Russia retaliate zelensky will cry.
Humiliations thought it was going to be an easy job to walk over Ukraine. Now some powerful countries will think differently after this.
Ukraine goes after military targets while Russia goes after civilian targets such as kids hospitals.
There we go putin can send drones after drones but Ukraine 🇺🇦 can’t because dictator putin don’t like.really you start the war not Ukraine 🇺🇦
"&quotattacks will not go unanswered in not the proper approach, Russia needs to seriously consider a response like in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the fight is obviously no longer with Ukraine, but with the US and NATO"
"Ukraine is 32 years old. Ukrainian s have had 32 years of propaganda fed to them. Ukrainians have had 32 yeas of brainwashing. Playing the victim is the Ukraine way. Putin is a gentlemen, and great statesman! Zelensky is a puppet on a string, and blood thirsty war monger! Ukrainian s got what they wanted in the Maidan rebellion, 2014. Ukrainian s made their bed, now sleep in it! You got Yanukovych out. You made Russian culture illegal. Now enjoy your state of poverty!"
"I don’t understand what retaliation is, you already bombing Ukraine what’s the difference"
Putin is a pathetic figure of a man.
Pay back day for Russia ...
"Just before Trump is sworn in, Ukraine has to come up with something big to give us a show."
"Russia, can t be this stupid.Of course.They re going to strike back when you attack somebody they defend themselves. Get out of ukraine!!"
This is a psychiatric hospital. Period. How in the world was it even possible to believe that Ukraine would win. Zero chance. Given the Russias superiority in air power and the nuclear weapons also the difference in population size and so on
Sesama eropa kok perang
Something more dangerous than oreshnic may be seen these soonest
Meanwhile Russians target houses. And we can t hear Arab criticism. Hipocrasy at its highest.
Russia has to retreat and pay compensation. Without fail.
Am a big fan of Russia but right now Putin did not have sense deal with Ukraine if u want to deal with them stop behaving like a fool
Sorry guys this one clown show is crazy need to stop this to save lives
by ALL them mean NONE
Russia has no shortage of retaliations on Ukraine btw. Russia already retaliates everyday. What is Russia talking about? Just does not make sense. The word retaliation must only be used by Ukraine not Russia
How is it to be a Russian and life a world made of lies? I mean everything Russia says is a lie. They went to war with a lie. How come?
"NOW, YOU ALL ARE HAPPY &amp EXCITED TO BROADCAST BLOODSHED PROPAGANDA AGAINST RESERVED &amp MANNERED RUSSIA 🇷🇺 ..

"This will be answered, and I feel sorry for Ukraine."
"Jonah Hull, needs to revue his troll notes. ruzzias oreshnik missile did almost zero damage other than setting a few fires"

Ukraine is boring and stupid.
izraeli ukrop bots struggling hard here
"More like NATO biggest attack on Russia. They even tried to attack chemical plants which goes to show that NATO are increasingly becoming desperate as they are doing everything to change course of the war, however the war has already last since 2023 Ukraine massive summer offensive disaster"
Putin want more potatoes carrots  give Putin food
Confusion on Russia defence force
Yes! Ukraine is winning and will take back all stolen lands!!!
"Well, I m watching your Western channels, what they say about Russia, and I live in Russia, in Siberia, and I m thinking does an ordinary citizen in the Western world really believe in this nonsense? Of course, we may also have such a channel, but I don t watch TV except movies and TV series. Russian Russians are not empty, I can safely travel to almost any country, to the Western world, through Turkey, of course, it will not be correct for everyone to speak for all Russians or Russians, personally I am proud that I am Russian and live in Russia, I have everything that you have in the USA or in Germany! Peace to all and good luck to you! This is my original in Russian, which I translated using Google into English, I hope he translated my text correctly)"
"Ukrain are the ones retaliating, russia is on the attack. russia started this."
Comedy sick
"Russia always threatening and never doing something that really ends everything, all talk that s why Russians are not respected"
"The idea of the “joker” is to provoke Russia, rally global support, and drag NATO into a war if Russia acts irrationally. However, I believe Russia is waiting to see what Trump intends to do. If this continues with Trump’s backing, I am certain Russia will launch a full-fledged war against NATO."
"You cannot retaliate retaliation. Think of something new, Putin. Oh, you re out of people and material? Too bad MF!"
They are loosing more land on the battlefield you would think thats were they will send the attacks.
where is the Oreshnik? Why is Zelensky still walking the earth today?
As zelensky said Out of 26 russian drones 15629462 were shot down Im zelensky and i don t work without magic powder
Make Russia Great Again. [Trump] I m coming.
"This war need to stop. Escalation is taking entirely different dimension, Ukraine needs to be careful of unwanted repercussions."
"I think Ukraine has crossed all lines, it should already surrender after 3 days, not making laughing stock from ruSSia."
Governments and their masters are out of control and need to be stopped permanently Guilty!
Is the anchor from new zeal and? He looks familiar
Russia shot down all of the missiles
When Russia retaliated that boy from Ukraine will cry the loudest. He forgets this
"Russian agents, you kncked off one of my accounts for a day. I am back with another."
Let Russia keep whining. Russia striking Ukraine for 3 years.
neither Russia or Ukraine is winning but it s shame on Russia not able to defeat Ukraine though it s smaller country to them .
Bom the oil pipe lines?
"you can t get enough of touching Putin s balls, do you? Putin can blow us all . Lucky hes got a good head on his shoulders."

"Get out of Ukraine you barbaric, genocidal, subhuman, war-criminals...."
putin is simply an ego man*ac
Putin is out of sight and mind. His time is at the last moment.
"The only country that knows how to punish someone is USA. Russia keeps talking, but the US is badass"
Over 800k Ruxx Losses This is winning?
"Nope, will not work. End the war Putin, now."
I think ukraine has crossed all limits
"Russia, this is the time now."
Ukraine and its allies have continued to provoke Russia and am very sure they get what they want
"Russia said, countries who helped firing theses will be hold for accountable.... Biden is criminal."
Those are NATO drones and cruise missiles
We shall also respond stop scaring
poor russians
If Russia didn t start the conflickt then there won t be a conflict so what is Russia banging on about I will never understand
And the little green man will cry victom just like the JEW he is when Russia gives a power punch
"O wow, Russia will retaliate against Ukraine strike. Well, we all hope that Russia will not invade Ukraine in response . lolololololol"
Ukrainian leaders and Western allies acting irresponsibly. Poor Ukrainians will pay a heavy price for this. Can they stop oreshnik?
Ukraine is &quotwinning&quot
Ukraine has a right to defend itself
Russia is showing so much patience they need to stop that and be serious
"Whar rubbish. Oreshnik is not hypersonic and didn’t do any damage as it missed the city, luckily. Where are you getting your information? Russian mod ?"
Ukraine is in for a shock when Zion Don gets into office and all those precious weapons and tax dollars go straight back to Israel
When Russians vow to retaliate you know they got hurt bad......that debris is nasty ehh?
"President putin is too patient,,why are you allowing usa , Britain and other nato to strike deep inside,,than your are quite,, Americans are fighting you ,Ukrainians won t operate those atams system ,,Americans army and British army are striking with their missiles deep inside Russia,,,beware they will kill you putin before Trump took office,,,,President putin is sleeping too much ,,shake zelesky now ,"
"Come to Christ!!! Jesus is so loving. The trinity of Jesus, Father, god, Holy Spirit. May god bless you and forgive your sins. Jesus payed an ultimate price for our sins"
Russian vows of retaliation are just hysterical
"lol, retaliation? Are they going to invade Ukraine again?"
"Every time Ukraine defends itself, Russia vows retaliation. This is hardly newsworthy. They are at war with each other."
make war illegal please
Believe me Ukraine and its allies will cry hard!
"☪ Allah menghiasi dan menjaga langit yang terdekat dengan bintang-bintang, dan menjadikan mereka (bintang) peluru berpandu 🖍terhadap syaitan yang cuba mencuri dengar mesyuarat syurga. &lt&lt Quran 67:5 &gt&gt 🌙"
"Aljazeerah love war too much, every day and night war news, and als supporting terrorism and terrorists, very bad tv station"
What? Are they going to invade again?
"Wait! They shot down all and there s massive explosion, looks all those ones in the past that they claim to shot down are false."
Biden trying to give Trump hard time.
russia intercepts everything but still things get bombed who is lying here
"Actually, Russia got drunk and shot itself."
Stop war
The Quataris delete comments...
"Ukrainians become puppet and scrapsgoat of NATO during Zelensky s timeline... Shame on one the lowest level political game that brings only disasters, loss and misery to all parties"
"All sane people hate America and the countries America supports, not the people but the government of the country"
Wars everywhere humans are crazy.
"NO, NO, NO, NO, It isn t TRUE. Ukraine killed hundreds of Nth Koreans, Many Many Russians and destroyed their armoured vehicles as swell. This REVERSE BS. PROPAGANDA is ALWAYS SPREAD BY the &quotWHACKY INDIANS Of NEWS, &quotWION&quot. THESE CLOWNS NEVER CHECK ANTHING IS TRUE, JUST DO AS KILLER PUTIN SAYS! These reports are SO FUNNY TO READ!"
Both side Russian and Ukraine must on negotiation
"Why are both of you idiots from Ukraine and Russia, blowing up these poor people, who have nothing to do with it? You guys should have stopped this a long time ago."
When will Zelensky stop monkey dancing?
This channel spread propaganda
Putin has failed
Go Russia!
Ukraine is being decimated - Trump
Ukraine’s counter offensive = a deadly retreat
Sind wir jetzt mit dem vermutlich*? längsten militärischen pfurtz der militärischen Geschichte bald fertig ??? Ommg
"Dear Al Jazeera, I dont trust your information, Sorry."
"I still wonder how a living soul still think Ukraine is winning I still under how a living soul still thinks Russians is running low on who to mobilize When media have told us that Ukraine is force to mobilize 18years old boys, From space you can see Ukrainians cemeteries clearly and western media still telling you that Ukraine will win or winning So naive to think Russia will loose these war"
It’s not a stalemate in any ways
"It is you who are bluffing, but it is Zelensky and Ukraine who are getting beaten."
Don t blame Ukraine blame Russia for all the problems
"Al Jazeera is more trustful than these fake and biased Western media like BBC, CNN, DW, Guardian, and many others. Why is there no hue and cry ?? If Russia occupies Ukraine for security reasons, the whole Western media talks nonstop not only for sanctions against Russia but also for weaponising Ukraine with arms, ammunition, and heavy weapons. Now, where s that fake Western media ? Would they be talking the same language as they are using against Russia, and would they be arming Greenland/Denmark, Canada, and Panama with same kind of weapons in case the US take Greenland, Canada and Panama."
"The 16th sanction package shows American Impotence, not it s Importance. &ltfacepalm&gt"
"What do you call those who stormed the government with weapons? In the USA they are called “domestic terrorists”, but in Ukraine they were called “Maidan”... Zelensky is an anarchist, he is not legitimate and has no right to be the president of a democratic country, especially since the legitimate president elected by real elections was forced to flee the country when the anarchists tried to attack his house in 2014."
"Zelensky is not the president of Ukraine. He is one of those who took over the country by armed force in 2014. Ukraine s democratically elected president was forced to flee death when anarchists attempted to storm the presidential residence with guns. No need to call Zelensky president! President Zelensky s term of office ended on May 15, 2024. He is no longer the president. He does not have such powers to be president. He banned elections in Ukraine. By all indications, he is a dictator."
Who knew their ofrensive would fail ? the Russians certainly did and they were waiting for them
I feel zero remorse for Russia. Talk to your President Vlad. He can stop this today. Only he can stop you getting counter attacked.
"Russia, country of slaves, where its people live in poverty and die by the 1000 s in a foreign country so a small elite lavish in Moscow...talk about dumb people"
Last week Ukrainian Trolls was celebrating on Ukraine Kursk offensive... I wonder where they are now. They had 6hrs only for celebration.
Putin invaded for empire.
Putin had 6000 nukes (5884 by traty) when he invaded the second time on 24 February 2022. Ukraine had zero. Explain how Ukraine would be an existential threat to Russia.
Joshuawhatever garbage
Standing there with notepads.....really....give me a gd break!!! I call BS!
"At 15 minutes this thread had 59 posts, all prowar russian. Now, an hour later, there are over 200 posts, many if which are one-sentence memes some going back 200 years."
It s over for Ukraine especially with Trump in office. He will cut all aid to Ukraine and will likely lift all US sanctions on Russia. That is the current reality
REPELS = a new pro-Russian word for barely hanging on and severely getting our arse s kicked
"This war is to lock NATO member s in recession. it s not about territory. Germany and Poland soon will raise its white flags, Slovakia to follows, also others. While export stops with the BRICS as 45% world potential buyer s gone. the manufacturer, farming and many possible buyer leaves the European markets. The BRICS cheaper price will be a major threats. China market gone, soon all 3rd worlds countries market are also gone from the European cashcows. Unemployment will rise and government will be toppled."
Would not want to be Russian in this day and age good lord what monsters. 
"Russia is gaining ground, but losing manpower. Russia isn t winning because it s not making noticeable gains with minimal price paid. They are incredibly inefficient, which gives Ukraine to better them."
this Ukraine man said this its used to be a kitchen here and a Living room What Russia Putin destroyed in Ukraine invasion Sad
"Funny how they keep trying to report things as equal, when it s only Russia that is advancing every where. Not to mention Ukraine has only lasted this long because of all of the sanction on it s economy as well as Ukraine being financed and armed by the West."
“That was the bathroom!!”
There is no fighting in kursk
The Kursk offensives forces Putin to seriously guard the entire border with more than rent-a-cops and green recruits. A bigger deal than many will admit.
"Imagine invading your peaceful neighbor, then being mad that the border is unsafe."
Zelensky can t stay without a joke move
I stop listening when an analyst says stalemate.... The nonsense will not stop
Hypocrite news channel
Kursk- the graveyard of western armies...and Ukraine.
Zelensky gone mad with power
"The idiot saying neither side has achieved anything strategic, crimea now has a land based corridor! no longer just that stupid bridge Ukraine was obsessed with…"
"You need to see the video, Russia mercilessly repelled the Ukrainian counter offensive "
"When someone describes the current status as strategic stalemate, you can bet your behind that you are being lied to. USA propaganda."
Zelensky wants to run for president again hoping that the media may keep tormenting us with his ugly face and constant lies.
Ukraine is losing on all fronts. This clown Zelensky is becoming a comedy himself.
Ukraine advancing backwards all along the front. &quotVICTORY plan&quot!
"This Kursk counter-offensive has been an utter failure in every way - with 50,000 Ukrainian casualties and the loss of more equipment than in the disastrous 2023 summer offensive. Far from a stalemate, the Russian gains are accelerating everywhere. How did Al Jazeera become a mouthpiece for Western propaganda?"
More wishful thinking from the usual quarters
Russia is a problem for Europe!
the Russians have taken back over 60% of the area Ukraine occupied and hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are dead.. Just for a PR stunt...SAD.
STOP SPREADING RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA!!! Ukraine is winning and will take back all stolen lands
Russia will be forced to negotiate when Trump comes in because the Russian economy is not doing well and may go towards recession leading to complaints from citizens about the war.
"If russia would be Israel, al jazeera would say its genocide, Al Jazeera biggest hypocrisy"
All of the equipment s which are used to invade Kursk were supplied by NATO. I started to appreciate Russia s patience
"Tell us where counteroffensive has gone, has Ukraine gained anything from it?."
Russia a super power in losing tens of thousands of men.
And Adolf Putin thinks he could defeat the west/NATO
Ukraine is &quotwinning&quot
"Zelensky is running out of time. With the unpredictable Trump coming into office, he could cut off aid anytime, he needs something to showcase."
why are zelensky men fighting for potato fields and not to defend their land
Stalemate? with Russia occupying 20% of Ukraine and making steady advances
When your boss is USA 🇺🇸
"I never seen BBC interview the Palestinians, why is that it’s a pity they only interview the once that they favour and has something to do with ."
Buh Ukraine keep on claiming they winning the ware
Who can hold Russia to account?
Russian victory is inevitable in this proxy war by the NATO Forces
All because Putin just can’t live without a bit more land
Western propaganda at its best
Sad to see so many people cheering on Russia for invading a sovereign country. What an embarrassment
Hmm Ukraine is winning is all I know
"I hope this war finally ends! I’m sick of the Ukrainians begging for money! All they do is beg, beg and beg!"
"From the video, I think Putin will be ok with settlement repayment and rebuilt all the land under annexation. At the end its their land annex for generation, if they don t mind change nationality to Russian."
Ukrainians are smoking something dangerous
Ukraine had it coming when they put the future of their country in the hands of the US and NATO.
"War crimes, what a joke"
Most of staying and wait for freedom finally
"NEVER THINK THE U.S. IS YOUR FRIEND, NEVER DO WHAT THEY TELL YOU."
Ukraine government hear western interest and forgotten the citizens of Ukrainians
Where is the VICTORY PLAN?
When you choose a clown as your commander in chief. Stupidity
I thought they are winning? Now even on social media they can t win. Lol
"For 8 years Ukraine was doing the same to Donbass, killing 14 000 civilian Russians and not a word from western media. And now that Russia has had enough and went on attack suddenly all western media noticed that the war is going on. The war started in 2014 when Ukraine started to bomb Donbass. Where were you back then ??? Pathetic journalizm"
Ukraine must take the Russian settlement.
"I apologize in advance for my cynicism. simply speaks the language closest and most native to her. Yes, it is Russian. "
"GOD bless Russia,Glory to Russia in jesus mighty name Amen,,,"
"The cause and foundation of the problem is italy and France Paris,Rome,Napolitano,Napoli,America, Rome,Taranto,Torino,Sardegna,,,"
Your not smart if you think Ukraine had a chance to win this war. Russia has already won the war. An could have easily nuked Ukraine and ended it 4 years ago. Your a fool if you think Ukraine ever had a chance.
Russia is not Israel so volunteers no need to worry about
"West keep pouring more resources to unwinnable war, instead of looking after their own citizens, when will they learn"
You allowed a stupid puppet into office now here are the consequences. Following the interests of an imperialist country thousands of miles away rather than building an economic and strategic alliance with your neighbour! How stupid!
It’s amazing to me the people who think Palestinians should never surrender also think Ukrainians should give up their land.
Aljazeera doing what it knows best
Your failing to do the same in Gaza
Russia has full right to defend itself 
"Since Ukraine invaded Kursk, there will no be negotiations."
I thought Ukraine was winning the war
Russia have nothing left!
Peace is Hot  Subject.. How fast the Stock Market Investors become in the Poor house  if Russia gets Peace in Europe and China Peace in Israel?
"Zenelsky doesn t want negotiations, he wants more war. Thank him, people"
Extremely sad
"Sadly, the US and NATO created this."
Please go to the negotiation table before starting Putin’s enthusiasm for new regions!
I used to like you guys before but now you are pro Ukraine
"Don t run to follow your leader, just stay at home you will be saved by Russian."
Its in danger of being Liberated. Stop taking sides aljazzera  you people sicken me
RUSSIA WANT EASTERN UKRAINE IT IS HISTORICALY RUSSIA🇷🇺🇷🇺 mineral also their
US tax payers money is wasted in Ukraine Taiwan by oldman biden....
Russia is holding Ukraine accountable for inviting an enemy to their doorstep. This is what happens when you don t consider the consequences of your actions.
NATO has failed to beat Russia
Russia is liberating Ukraine from the Azov neo Nazis battalion. One day when there s peace in Ukraine. They will thank Russia.
"Al Jazeera, tell us honestly that you are being held on the money of Israel and the United States. And you will answer together with them"
Russia has the right to defend itself
Seeing brothers fighting and with exterior influence is deplorable.
Ukranian speaker in Kharkiv? Yeah right
"the folks in Kiev don t listen to Ukrainians, they listen to Washington DC."
Bull ya ll told us Russia lost steam and ammo back in 2022.
Ukrainians are jokers. Unconditional surrender is whatever will get.
And the pro russian ones are still hanging around waiting for the Russians to arrive.
Zelensky is to blame of all what is happening in Ukraine
Why is the British Expeditionary army not there ?
Many Ukrainian women available for sale in Poland other European countries force to marry old men.western gangs busy to kidnapping Ukrainian women.
The green t shirt is the real war criminal as he has no respect for his own people. He should better know that such an impaired war can t be won.
Ukrainian speaking Russian
Hah! 34 Countries and all the western propaganda against one Russia. And still you can t win. Frustrating
Russian bots using an American platform on American invention. And you think yoursrlve’s superior
And Ukraine is winning
Worst media now includes al jazeera
Who still believe that Ukraine can win...?
I think ukraine troops move forwards .... to Kiev ....
"NATO, “War crimes against Russia should be prosecuted. But Israel has 100% impunity and continues its genocide against the Palestinian people with US, UK, France, Germany and others blessings!”"
"Russia vs US,EU,NATO and still winning on the GROUND! I wonder how much more territory they would have liberated by now if they were not facing over 2000+ sanctions like EU, NATO, US"
Make sure to investigate Ukrainian army war crimes to stay impartial. So many reports of Ukrainian army hiding among the civilians and fighting from hospitals and schools.
Fake news. US/Western media telling everyone that Ukraine is winning and Russia will collapse - that’s why more money has been sent to Ukraine before Biden leaves office. Victory is at hand for NATO.
"But, but, but I thought Ukraine was winning with all those advance NATO weapons and the 50 thousand Western volunteers from the West lol"
Is Jonna Hull an ALJAZEERA journalist or a british spy ?
i thought Ukraine was winning? why is there another ukranian city under evacuation?
Every time it the old people who are lst to evacuate I don t know why they wait til the last minute.
Am sure Ukraine didn t commit any war crime . dude gathering so called evidence is just wasting his time. let be frank.
"Joe and Hunter Biden s corruption put Ukraine on the path to war with Russia and has led to the death, injury and displacement of millions of people while Biden s associates in the arms industry pocketed billions of dollars."
"Russian victory is inevitable and thank heavens! Any other result would embolden the western powers to plow onward with their goal of becoming supremely dominant globally. Since 9/11 their goal has been to remove and replace every last obstacle to this goal. If they win we will certainly live on a de facto prison planet, observed, monitored and punished for unacceptable thoughts, speech or actions. Be warned... and pray for that inevitable victory of Russia s. And of course help bring it about in whatever way you can."
Selensky sold Ukraine to NATO to use its citizens to flight Russia
Investigate the war crimes of the British in their former colonies
The relentless attacks on Kharkiv highlight the urgent need for a negotiated settlement that prioritizes de-escalation and addresses Russia s legitimate security concerns regarding NATO expansionism. The continued push for Ukrainian &quotvictory&quot by the US and its allies only prolongs the suffering of civilians and risks a catastrophic wider conflict.
All these poor Ukrainians were killed and forced out of their homes for USAs gamble to weaken Russia. For US military industrial complex only money talks.
"ask your self is this really about the Ukraine, well its not, all is about the USA/UK against Russia and the rest is details, this country was chosen as a battle field and Ukrainian did most of the work and take all the damage, after one year the USA/UK will not even remember they Ukrainian exist!!!- welcome to capitalism people, where you can be anything and nothing, but its not for you to choose -reality check they call"
War crimes documentation in the wrong place.....look little further in GAZA.....
"The u.s. had given their jewish masters in ukraine suicide drones, mines, and cluster bombs. What more evidence of war crimes do you need? They proudly confessed to providing banned weapons that violate the laws of war."
Ukraine 🇺🇦 is done
"Short reporting as usual. If it was a report on Russia loses,it would have been 30-50minutes of reporting"
Peace through strength!!! Said the green goblin
RUSSIA IS WINNING NATO
Zelensky has said that there will be no negotiations with Putin (he doesn t consider him a legitimate leader) and there s even a decrete forbidding it. Not to mention that the precondition for it to happen will be the full retreat of Russia to the 1991 borders - so why are we even talking about it?
It will be Russia by the end of February
They have some nerve to talk about Russian war crimes while the Ukraine military forces people to join the military.
Ukraine is not our enemy. Greetings from Australia. 🇦🇺🇺🇦
Result of stupidity.
When a Briton propagandist infiltrate the News giant
Why are they not investigate in Gaza.. this is double standard
Free Odesa from Ukriane NZ.
"Turkiye agreement was rejected on the pretense of &quotUkraine should negotiate on a stronger position&quot. Some years later with almost 20% land lost (don t mention the soldiers, according to them, only about 40k lost!), these crazy analysts are still selling this &quotstrong position&quot."
Zelensky will be arrested
"These poor folks looks like they don t care which country they live in, Russia or Ukraine, just let there be peace."
Every one need to stand with ukraine ... for freedom of ukraine pepoles ..
Hold isreal to account for the genocide in gaza
"Instead of arming Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan US tax payer money should be spent on infrastructure, healthcare, education, homelessness etc."
some Russian Banks are already collapsed and Cremlin it s supporting them... it s time for People to take back money from bank... or high risk to lose money...
"Thats incorrect, the EU have been constantly reducing interest rates."
Any russian here to talk to me how economy is and tell me everything about it ??
The Russian Economy is still working nothing has stopped yet. Plenty of work and house prices going up. We just holiday at home now. Russia is winning the war and more land I think Ukrainian is about to collapse in two months.
The Russian Economy is still working nothing has stopped yet. Plenty of work and house prices going up. We just holiday at home now.
I hope the inflation keep going up skyrocketed… until their ppl finally realize whom to blame
My friends own the Aldi supermarkets
noooo.... but wasn t the economy boominggg???
Russia going Down the derpå Black Hole …….for decades :-)
"Defence spending? Try invasion spending, they ain t defending anything."
Russian interest rates are too high and must be cut immediately.
"Interest rates in Russia are now too high , a three percentage point rate cut immediately is needed ."
It is easy to stop inflation. Tell Putin to move his troops behind the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine and stop the war. Peace can do wonderful things for a country.
i don t think Russia increased its defense spending. it increased its offense spending.
Buy Russian rubles
Russians can no longer afford McDonald. Oh wait there’s no longer McDonald s in Russia. No hamburger for you
Get rid of your terrorist leader and maybe things will get better
"Better start that bread lines, oh and you know what , is gonna get worse for a long time before it get worser"
Ah the looming stagflation situation. Once that hits it s all over but the crying.
"Most places experience inflation ,the only thing shrinking is the package size/volume of perishables, and the money spent on food. Either way —this raging conflict between nations is “old”, really time to just leave Ukraine alone and rebuild lives."
"What is this magical place I haven t visit for a long time? No, really guy. I have been reading comments under Endian &quotnews channels&quot and it felt like my brain was slowly rotting away. Now I m reading the comments under Al Jazeera News and it feels like people in the comments have 25 IQ points more. It s amost as if the Russian AI gang hasn t heard of this News Channel yet. For this refreshing experience, I would like to thank you ! And as a European let me say &quotshukran jazilan&quot and feel hugged!"
We buy Bitcoin Then the russian rubel is falling like a shitcoin
So the spoiled wealthy folks in Moscow don t like the high price of food? So enlist in the Army. Free food comrades.
Everything is going according to plan. for Putin. No one hates Russians quiet like Putin does.
Gdp growth means absolutely nothing if it is all because of government spending.
"Blame Putin, i bet he is not cutting back. How much of this war budget is going into private pockets. Putin has to pay for his boats upkeep"
Has Traveling With Russel been here to film and tell us how wonderful things are?
I am sure putin didn t expect that the war will continue until now
40 percent of money all go to building bombs . dont expect there is no domino effect on social services. there will be comes a time ordinary Russians will eat gunpoweder due to Putins ego
Tomato is 5x more expensive now.. can you believe it its only tomato in rusiya which anyone can plant but not on winters.. its jus tomato !!
Let them eat cake. You back Putler then go knock on his golden doors and ask him to feed you. I m sure he s eating very very well.
Let s russia open their market in Africa coz we are neutral we can do free business
"Whatever bad conditions russians have they will blame anyone (West, NATO, ukrainians, anglo-saxons etc) but themseves."
"Wheat and poultry Sunflower and fries food storage Roasted wheat to wheat storage for Russia Equipment of gardening part time hobbies it is good for today s life in Russia Own hobbies definitely helpfull for all who are surrounded spends lives related to gather Storages , storage , ploughing cultivation , farming of anything which has consumption it is good Doesn t waste time It s used in the time infuture definitely its helped sees too"
"Trying to explain a war and sanction stressed economy s inflation solely on demand is insane, only in this mad orthodoxical debate hegemony can such a travesty happen"
"Russian media trolls earn in one week, less than a western teenager earns per hour working at MacDonalds. Russia failed to take Ukraine. Clown Zelensky has the world laughing at Putin. China will take back their stollen land. Russia is a disaster!"
"400 years of oil, gas, coal, annual gold production to sustain 400 years of war with Ukraine. The Russian Orthodox are full of money....."
"In Russia there has been inflation since 1991, every year. Inflation that scares Europe is commonplace for Russians"
Everywhere is the same. Look at the prices in US. Don t trash Russia.
Shame that all this happened because of the SMO Stupid Military Operation.
"Only one person to blame……Pootin, get rid of him"
"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shattered its economy and global standing. Sanctions have crippled key industries, energy exports have plummeted, and discounted sales to few buyers offer little relief. Military spending drains resources, worsening poverty and increasing public resentment. As the war drags on, infrastructure and productive public spending deteriorates, the currency weakens, and recovery grows increasingly unlikely, leaving Russia on a path toward economic and societal collapse. Worse than all of this, is that Russia has created an enemy in Ukraine that never existed previously, as Ukrainians will never forgive Russia for its violent and senseless invasion."
"Danish here, you don t need to be in war to have your grocerie prices go up. Butter here is now 30 kroner ( 4 + US $), both diesel and gasoline keep rising."
"Russia has caused Worldwide Prices to go up, about time they reaped what they sowed. Time to get rid of Putin!"
The actual inflation is most certainly higher.
Putin is the new Napoleon
"Russia invaded Ukraine and started a war. When it’s not going well they blame everyone else. Blame it on the west. Russias army is being wiped out, 800,000 Soilders lost. 10,000 tanks, economy now suffering. Is it worth it Russia ?"
Market been there 100 years selling local food for local prices. They now claim &quotMeat&quot is an overpriced luxury and potatoes have gone up 90% ? Sure sanctions push up import prices of foreign goods but local produce it all local rubles. Inflation seems to be more than the official 9% and it doesn t look like it will improve in 2025. Putin has stolen the abundant riches of the largest country in Europe and now he is going to starve and kill his own people for his war.
The mainstream media are an intellectual embarrassment
Russia s GDP grew almost 4% in 2024. Don t listen to the mainstream media
If Ukraine offers unconditional surrender. Then it s all back to normal. You can t defeat Russia. From a Swede. We marched towards Moscow and failed. Napoleon Failed. Hitler got close. What are you thinking...
It s always America Russia blames!
Russia is going to resemble The Weimar Republic.
Putin is just another colonialist war criminal. Why does the largest country in the world need more land?
Western propaganda only
"All this, the death and destruction of so many, all for one man’s hubris."
World is facing not only Russia. Reporter must be rich or government officer or political person who get free food from government.
"It s amazing how Russians with these conditions are not yet asking themselves for what and for whom are they even fighting for. They are not fighting for freedom, they are not even fighting for oppression nor they are not fighting to protect the lives of their people."
"The Russian government intent on bringing back 90 s Russian bread lines to fulfill the desires of their expansionist, megalomanical leader. Smallest violin plays."
"The inflation last year in Spain was more or less the same, and the same companies fleece the WORLD¡"
That display of fruit and veg looked delicious
"Why is this news? Russia always had high food prices. A pound of meat costs almost a as much in Russia as in Uk or Poland. I don’t know the minimum wage in uk, in Poland is somewhere near $600 and in Russia is $150"
Inflationof 10% when you have interest rates of over 20%. That is really a bad sign…… most wars are lost not on the battle groud but due to bancrupcy and lack of recources
"Nothing new here gov spending, capital controls and private sector investment always drive up inflation while s wage growth as we see. The real driver of the inflation in this case is sanctions clearly inputs for production of essential goods is high due to secondary purchases from third party countries, thats why Russia is aligning economically with Asia, to import cheap machinery"
"Don’t call them Russians, proper name is DegeneruZZians"
The strongest economy in the world they said.. (Russia)..
Russia will win over America consporacies
How russians benso dump in this age of information.
Prices are crashing in the usa. The food companies dont want to upset trump.
Right now every country is facing the same economic crisis not only Russia so kindly stop your propogonda machine
Russia wanted and waged war on Ukraine so they must take the repercussions that go along with war . You wanted it you got it so stop whinging and whining about it .
Russian economy collapse All will run to Dubai or Thailand
Wait what is our excuse? Seems everything is almost double in America. We don t have any wars on our borders.
You mean war economics in us and eu and uk does not push their inflationary hardship on to it own people?
"lol, the Central bank is raising rates 2x the &quotofficial&quot inflation rate. That would be madness...unless the inflation rate is dead wrong."
"All Russians from the state of Russia stand up. I see stand up for other things, but this is more important."
"Just let your boy Putin, stop invading other country territory s. If this is happening in Russia, let Russia address it to their government starting from the hit top down to the government. Love, Russia I’ll leave it as that ."
"Inflation is everywhere, even in India the food prices have increased !"
that Axe is too hefty. ONLY IN RUSSIA
Is non of ur business focus on the West if I was Putin all this western media outlets I will ban them in operating in my country
the world is experiencing inflation
On bright side Putin is still the richest man in Russia
The reason Inflation is rising so fast is Russia is because how bad their currency is falling ……it’s lost almost half its value in the year
They love to highlight Russia while ignoring their own cost of living crisis in their own countries!!
No wonder this Western propaganda is banned in most middle eastern countries
"Even here Nigeria, there is humongous inflation"
Well they are still support the war in UKRAINE so 0 sympathy for this people.
"In Sweden inflation since the start of the pandemic has been very high driven by energy cost and cost of houses and condominions. When it comes to food, meat and fish has gone up very much. The whole western world is having inflation and houses are starting to be impossible for the middle class everywhere not just Russia."
This is what you get for voting for Putler
I see increase here in the UK despite what the press may say.
Every country is facing inflation not only Russia
thats because of your foolish leaders who thinks russia is his got it
AJ going full bootlicking mode for the US cartel! keep rocking!
Need to do rural areas. Not just Moscow and St. Petersburg.

Russia cannot win this war. Putin is stubborn and hard headed..
"That produce in the market look of high quality. The lady is however wrong, stagflation is already happening."
Russia Economy is also Brics Economy .....and Brics go ....and Prices also in Nato Country ....is crazy Increase

"Join the club. All people, minus billionaires and millionaires, are in the same boat."
"Even a country without a war, is also facing Inflation, just like here in the Philippines."
Even the US have an Inflation problem
"Russia could be experiencing this 3 years after the war, kindly check with the western world about the same. You would wish you never brought this trivial matter here today. The western world is drowning with inflation, and this will get worse in Europe with Ukraine banning transportation of cheap Russian gas to the EU."
"Countries where you can make money? Why should the state tax the population? Even though people cannot make money. What does the state make money for?why don t you go to school to learn how to make money? After graduating from school, why should you earn money?Why doesn t the state set up a school majoring in design and printing money? After graduating, why are you required to earn money?"

"Israel , The only country in middle east with good democracy"
Russian terror or Zelenski and USA government terror?
This war should end.
Why is Ukraine fighting
I DONT UNDERSTAND EVERY TIMES ONE OR TWO PEOPLE DIE HOW RUSSIA DO THAT THEY CALL BEFORE THE ATTACK AND TELL PEOPLE TO Run
This people think that we still in 1912 that they can put lies
BBC just bought Al Jazeera lol
Blame the west that war would have ended long ago
ooo I have no Idea why this happened . Oo out of nothing Russia strikes Ukraine. what ignorance social media really thinks we are ignorant of whats going on. Especially Zelinsky . Really ? you think anybody in the west really cares what happens? Really! man so much distruction and for what? Because you want bombs in your country. Look at Mexico - America rules Mexico and they are fine . They work around the world empire trying to keep peace and at the same time maintain there sovereignty. You have elections and they have elections. you have currupted presidents they have corrupted presidents. Look at trump the worlds Democracy has chosen the most corrupt Elite as their president thats the why the world works. The west has proven that Power makes right. The west has lost all moral authority or more like excuses that they dont want war with Russia. Just be a man and tell the Truth West you want to distroy Russia in peaces because you dont want them to Allie with China as a finacial institution that risks the west being a financial powerhouse or the worlds empire.
Kursk counteroffensive
Earlier I believed what BBC SKY SUN DW CNN told me about Russian army... But now I genuinely belive Russian army is one of most morale and humane army in the world love Russian army
Zelensky is far removed from reality
I blame the west
NATO S puppet Clown Zelensky wants this!
Hope this will be over soon. All of this is men made.
"Zelensky think he still acting action movies,"
"This is what any country will happen or get when you make or allow someone who s not ethnically the natives of any land becomes a leader or the president.....now Ukrainians are sowing the seeds of the cardinal sin, where a non-native Ukrainian became president and thus causing the country to its knees by fantasizing NATO membership and being united States puppet!!"
"GOD bless Russia,Glory to Russia in jesus mighty name Amen"
"The cause and foundation of the problem is italy and France Paris,Rome,Napolitano,Napoli,America, Rome,Taranto,Torino,Sardegna,??"
Meanwhile we were told Nato is winning the war in Ukraine
Thats who Russia is! For anyone questioning!
Actually it s a military factory - Motor Sich. Collateral damage.
Ukraine must burry their ambitions to join NATO or else they don t know the meaning of who PUTIN is.
Zelensky is a comedian
Russia has the right to defend itself
Imagine forcing a nuclear power country that a joke
"As you can see, no one said anything about warning. Unlike some entitled people"
Fake news channel like BBC and CNN
The UN is a paper Tiger they cry over all kinds of things but let Russian murder thousands.
Donald Trump would never let this happen In Europe
zelensky...get lost of ukraine for better!
West should help to Ukraine 🇺🇦 to defend themselves from aggressor
But comedian doesn t stop being comedian on blood of citizens...so obsessed with being west
"Europa, Europa 2020g.ode od nas.. nečemu plakati, umremo prije svega,sada!!ha ha"
"Grande Russia! Mai vs Europa.Tirata per i capelli da usa e nato,non dai popoli europei."
"Iran and Russia sell oil to the West. Then they produce inferior weapons. The West is getting more greedy. Even though it is the world s richest country, it is not satisfied. They wants to destroy Iran and Russia."
now EU will buy Same Russian gas at 100 times high price after rerouting it from Asian Countries. ....isnt n it master stroke Of EU Nations..
What a coincidence. The WEFs goals are being implemented perfectly by world events.... almost like it is all planned?
"And US will always win and get benefit on behind war scene, Europe get Collapse, what a foolest Zelensky?!"
"Europe spent the past 3 years preparing for this. The media’s trying to make this into a big deal but it was a mutual decision between both the EU and Ukraine. Ukraine did their part by honoring the contract, despite being at war, and Europe used that time to find alternatives. Now the contract expired they have no reason to renew it"
"..the deliberate evil done in war, has nothing to do with the cordiality of peace."
How much money in transit fees Ukraine will not receive? Millions $$$$
New transit agreements have to include war reparation tariff for Ukraine.
The key to peace in Europe? Offer both Ukraine and the Russian Federation full and immediate membership in both NATO and the EU.
"Ukraine has decided that it does not want to prolong gas transit, if anyone is so stupid, Russia paid Ukraine, Ukraine refused free money. Ukriana is asking for energy from other countries but has stolen it, only pathetic puppet countries without their own opinion help it, these people have no pride, let s see how the prices will rise, Europeans are richer than Russians, they can stand it, oh stop in Russia and prices are lower for everything, maybe even in Russia people live better during the war and under sanctions than in puppet Europe. Well it will be a lesson that zombie Europeans should not have supported Ukraine in killing Russians...."
"EU is on a suicide mission, they forego cheap gas for expensive one just to Please the master across the ocean, its only the ordinary people who suffer always."
EU administration is made up of fools and idiots.
LOL. Those ex soviet countries took russia generousity for granted. Now they have to pay dearly for killing russians who care for them.
Now Ukraine and Europe to buy Gas from other countries with an High price good job guys
"Dont blame Ukraine, Blame Russia because Putin is Evil."
UK just raise their fair price of Bus by 50%
Slovakia had three years and it been told earlier that contract ends in 2025. What Slovakia wants?!
"Life in europe is getting more and more expensive each year, this year my rent rose up like 20€ higher or more along with the electricity. Also food, preservatives and other beverages have gotten almost twice as expensive in the last few years. I remember coke being sold for a bit over 2€ 4-5 years ago. Now its 4,40€ a 1,5l bottle here in finnish stores. Prices on alcohol are getting higher too. Pretty much every enjoyable product gets a higher price at every single store every year and or a few months. No wonder people are upset and moody around here."
And now EU countries can go and beg USA for gas lines even NATO countries to but now European countries can stop given Ukraine government billions to trillion dollars in aid since theres no more gas and oil from Russia
"Ice age starting in EU, as climate change started."
No Effect for EU !! We will pay 3times more money !
"Crazy to think that Russia still sending gas to Ukraine even though they are at war with each other. This proves that Russia isn t weaponizing the energy as EU and collective west always say on the mainstream media. In fact it s the other way around - the collective west bombed the Nordstream pipeline (which was done by some Ukrainians as reported by the mainstream media) so Germany don t have access to cheap Russian gas, and now Ukraine not extending the contract, leaving Moldova, Slovakia, and Hungary looking for other ways to get Russian gas."
"End of an agreement, it ends."
"We are buying Russian gas via Asian countries at marked up prices, hence our bills. Russia is doing fine, we are shivering. Blowing Nordstream was a real own goal for most of Europe. Coincidentally the US wishes us to buy their gas but the logistics are poor. Whatever is offshore Gaza, it should be recalled that a war crime is proceeding."
EU economy will wither as they are buying American freedom gas at 4X prices. Industries will move out. Homes will not be warm this winter. Ukraine is EU Armageddon. USA will profit……again and again.
"It seems that 007 is from Russia, not from the UK!"
I never thought I d live in a world where cheap gas is bad for Westen Europe....crazy times...
This is where the remaining EU s Public support to this war ends. Wonder for how long these western puppet &quotleaders&quot will remain on their seats.
"Putler bots are lying more than usual, lol. Ukraine must have done something right."
The EU is buying Russian gas from India and Turkey
Sounds like a special shutoff operation.
Germany closed all its nuclear power plants in response to the Fukushima disaster so started buying gas from Russia.
Seems like nato are sanctioning themselves
No big deal for Russia. India and China will step up their purchase of Russian oil. The Indians will resell the oil and profit from Ukraine s misery. China will get more cheap oil. Russia will not lose a single cent. Trump will demand EU buy more expensive American LNG and claim a victory for himself.
"The Russian gas will find its way to Europe with more expensive price. Winner: US, Norway, Russia, Turkey. Looser: Europe, Ukraine."
It is not Russia or Ukraine. It is globalization to blame which made people think they were safe while being dependent to another country for resources. Ukraine has all the right to defend the country. Slava Ukraine
Why Putin is crying ? Hungary ans Slovakia did this to themselves.
"I m really offended by Zio-Western warmonger s lies and violence, these people provoked the Ukraine war, destroyed the Nordstream gas supply to Germany and then blamed Russia for everything."
I am not surprise that some countries don t want your biased channel.
"Great news for Europe. We are finaly free from the russian neo-nazis and drug addicts. Cherry on the cake : Slovakia and Hungary, aka Putler’s puppets, will pay the price for their threason of our beloved EU and NATO."
40% more for US LNG that makes sense
"Putin Fan ,I love russia"
russia is a terror state
"Russian war funds reduce ,Arginine the rising gas pioner Sorry for Russia"
Slava Ukraini!
Putin best Oil &amp Gas customer was ( GERMANY)! Norstream pipe line 1 &amp 2 go to Germany
All gas will be imported from Brussels for free. Nothing to worry about !
"GOD bless Russia,Glory to Russia in jesus mighty name Amen,"
"The cause and foundation of the problem is italy and France Paris,Rome,Napolitano,Napoli,America, Rome,Taranto,Torino,Sardegna?,,,"
"Out of curiosity since im not from Europe, are European citizens happy about this decision?"
Can buy from US
So Putin thinks all Ukraine problems were caused by a another
Ukraine is %100 correct.
Pay Attention Europe. You all joined NATO for protection from Russia! Learn your lesson! Europe
In UK I used to pay £1400 a year for gas. now I pay £ 2840 and people are worried about the gas price going up again in April 2025
Dog Zelensky biting EU hands. hahaha
No more oli and gas only
"Russians suffer the most no matter how u look at things, it,s Russia against whole Europe"
First step to russias downfall europe getting energy independent from it !
The hypocrite euros have switched to buying russki lng lol
Well slovakia and hungury are not obligated to give ukraine electricity. Looks like they will need all the energy them selves.
As we edge closer to the madness of World conflict.
Everyone is moving away from fossil fuel so cutting off gas will force Europe to seriously invest in alternative energy i think the GRASS benefits not the Elephants
Great timing for the EU. Bust out the cozy blankets.
Excellent news. Well done Ukraine. Fico is an infantile imbecile. He reaps what he sows.
European clowns giving up affordable Russian gas and getting self destructed by dancing to the tune of Uncle Sam
Stop Oil Use renewable energy instead of nasty gas
Iran is soon to be at war with taliban controlled afganistan 2025 is going to be lit
8% of lacking gas will have an impact.... Its huge.
Ursula von der leyen the Zionist supporter.
its honestly amazing that ukraine has been allowing russian gas to pass through its territory this whole time.
Trade wars are gonna impact everyone in coming days. Buy whatever you want now. Prices are gonna hike very soon.
Is ukraine the bad guy yet
The NORTHERN ASIAN FEDERATION of the many many non russian STATES has 66 million men and 77 million women …and 1.5 -2 million people with HIV…….ONLY GERMAN AND POLAND HAVE 60 million men
the northern ASIAN FEDERATIONof so MANY...so MANY non russian states..is ISOLATED..not sanctioned ..like N Korea or Iran...ISOLATED and medievally aggressive. russians forced ukranians to learn russian for more than 100 years....UILTRA medieval..the only nation to force other natiuons to learn another langiage......and move millions to Siberia in order to bring more russians in
"the northrn ASIAN FEDERATION is just a BUCKET of RESOURCES for the world = oil gas precious metals, other metals, grains and white women looking for money..a land that only produces cheap low quality weapons like N Korea"
Thats basically a top list of everything negative that happened in Russia in 2024 so it s pretty biased and one sided. Yes the Central Bank increased its interested rate to 21% but at the same time the Russian GDP grew by more than 4% in 2024. Yes there is the Ukrainian incursion in Kursk there they managed to occupy a single tiny town of Sudzha (5000 residents) and the surrounding villages but at the same time through the year Russians have captured in Eastern Ukraine more than 200 settlements including several large towns and almost no one already speaks that Russia is going to lose the war. Yes some Middle Eastern dictator Russia supported was ousted but at the same time Russia hosted the BRICS summit in Kazan with 40 head of states appearing which basically has shattered any notion about &quotRussia s isolation&quot. And so on.
"Putin knowing and unknowing weakened mother Russia 🇷🇺…army is on the verge of collapse,Russia space is moving backwards,economy downgrading,lost in Syria, lost in Africa , losing Ukrainian war….this is a prime example of one man rule…"
Its not like putler care about Russia
"Aljazeera, can you add any positive news to this useless news article? The economic benefits that the people of Kursk have received, the rebuilding of Mariupol, or the growth of the Russian economy while being the most heavily sanctioned country. Or maybe the immense support and deplomatic relations that Russia enjoys in BRICS and outside the tiny Western minority. Or maybe the future release of a cancer vaccine. Don t be a propaganda news article that only spews the talking points of the West. What about Russia s discovery of the numerous American Bio-labs throughout Ukraine and Africa. Is that not news worthy? I mean labs that are a direct threat to all of humanity. You have just waited my time. Compete rubbish in the name news."
"A lot of other failures missing - guess they didnt have much time for the report. Nonetheless gives the correct impression overall, that nothing went right for the mafia criminals and murderers."
"ruZZia is a mafia state, and having the usual mafia problems, because of the corruption"
"i see right now 3 comments of 11, democracy"
Al Jazeera has a history of demonizing Russia and China while it whitewashes the crimes of Hayat Tahrir Al Shams in Syria
"GOD bless Russia,Glory to Russia in jesus mighty name Amen"
"The way Moscow rules, is just not appealing to human kind. You cant blame people for shunning away from Russia regime."
Al Jazeera low-key hates Russia
"Russia is more sanctioned than North Korea, Iran, the Taliban, and the Houthis? Hard to believe."
More sanctions to the Putin regime for crimes against humanity!
BOYCOTT QATAR AIRLINES for harbouring Hamas terrorists
Putin and his Russian bots be like “Russian birds are strong enough to shut down engines and penetrate the plane s rear. Nothing to see here it wasn t shot at.”
If it was Russian air defenses then the plane would have crashed on Russian territory it would never be able to make it to Kazahstan. The plane is shot with missile and yet it still travelled all the way across Caspian sea ?????
Putin? Alzheimers? Going to be a long winter is russia. He’s still fighting WW2.
Now why would Putin feel the need to apologize
"respect for President Putin who has dared to apologize for the Azerbaijani civil plane crash incident, prayers for the victims and their families"
more russian fascist lies !
What do the actors of the upcoming emerald city wizard (The Wizard of Oz ) think about Putins last move?
The MH17 was Ukraine and I bet this is Ukraine again. Ukraine are just incompetent with weapons - that s why they ve wasted half a trillion worth of weapons in this war.
"Putin has a short memory. It was under him that Russia supported the intervention in Iraq, and fought in Syria, where it bombed Aleppo. And the Russian soldiers on TV, when asked: &quotDo you shoot children?&quot, replied that they were little terrorists, and therefore, yes, they shoot"
"No I don’t think it’s called black male. What it’s called is either ore, you’re with me or you’re against me. Make it simple. Especially for you Arabs."
"ALLAHU AKBAR all sanctions will be lifted, why can t Syria develop or produce it medicine"
But can Europeans fight is problem come to Syria? Because 2014 Europeans didn t helped Syria
"Israel holding Special Policing Action by removing dangerouse equipment from Syria, with prejudice."
Russia is in Syria to stay. Who welcome US troops in Syria under Asad? European should Stop fooling themselves.
&quotBlackmail&quot nope. It s called geopolitics. When you attack a country and cause problems for others you should expect they will cause problems for you somewhere. This is what Russia is finding out in Syria..
"No, its not blackmail when the west does it. Rules based order, remember!"
"As unclear as it may be, the fact is Russia supported Assad who the country decided to overthrow. I don’t think this positions Russia well? Especially with Assad hiding there too. "
"Instead of arming Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan US tax payer money should be spent on infrastructure, healthcare, education, homelessness etc."
"EU : every country has their own right to decide their friends Syria : we d like to be friends with everyone, including russia EU : you re not allowed to do that, they bombed you Syria : so did you guys and US EU : shut the f*** up, remove russian personnel or you ain t gettin medicine and food ..... now that s how you make enemies, jihadists and refugees"
Syria is free to cooperate with whomever they wish.
If the price is right just present your tender
How funny Europe say and Arab listen.... Muslim country should create one block.... 
They shud not at all remove russian bases...russian bases shud remain there..if Syria wants to remain safe
After Assad ....Syrie Power is doubtfull ....who is Behind Rebel s Syrie? Who is together Usa s Diplomacy?
Question to UN and OIC - Why was no resolution passed yet to declare the terriorist Zion state as a terriorist organisation?
"Syria, don’t entertain the genocide supporting US and E3 regimes. Genocide enablers can never do any good to anyone, not even to US and E3 people."
I thought you have Atacms and Storm shadows use yours
Russia has right to defend itself
"russian copy the same jokes as israeli on comments , let see where is that going. You are not professional at all, this is not a comedy, you stupid fool. Ah i forgot, even football players has stupid fans, who jump on every action, actually the players are professional on both sides, but fans are getting out of control."
Bbc not allowed in Isreal and Philistine like Ukrine
What a indirect attack on EU
Russia has right to defend itself.
Why are politicians acting stupid always killing innocent civilians
Zelinsky asked for more missiles.....
Millions of souls have to pay the price of two disagreeing men. See what world has become
They love playing victims
I thought trump would be able to solve this war in less than 24 hrs
RUSSIA HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF!!!
Al Jazeera have all these posts looking for war crimes in Gaza but not one in Ukraine what a shiyte new service..
It’s just so unfair and wrong that the People who decide to wage all these Wars are the ones least affected by its horrors while those who have no say in the decisions are the ones who suffer the most.
Just got to look at the low IQ comments on here from Russian bots to see how lame Ytube is.
You assassinate a General and you expect flowers  from Russia are u guys okay?
"why you messing up with the mother country? what you want what you get! sorry, mother land is mad!"
Please release zaid in Saudi from India he is honest because he is not affordable this type of crime please cover this report he is simple workers
Putin has many weapons in his inventory
Zelensky ia betrayed Ukrainians for Mosad and Cia
I guess Russian showels are pretty useful
Ukraine should have submitted. I mean NATO expansion is not acceptable
"BIDEN FOOLED UKRAINE, AND NOW HES LEAVING TOO, JUS FOOLISH ZELENSKI"
Zelensky s voice is irritating and annoying... Sounds like a fart!
Karma is coming to putin
The missiles are surely now speaking  for themselves. Comedian Zelensky Stupid game gets Stupid prize. inviting the Bear  to dance means the bear gets to decide when the dance party ends.
Ukraine shot down all 46 missiles out of 16
The missiles have spoken for themvelves.
Blame your western masters especially America

"The cause and foundation of the problem is italy and France Paris,Rome,Napolitano,Napoli,America, Rome,Taranto,Torino,Sardegna,,,"
Where is your news about the strike on Rssa 🇷🇺 ???
Russia attacks INNOCENT civilian infrastructure. Obvious war crimes. Where is the condemnation from Al Jazeera? Wat is wrong with your readers who don t condemn these war crimes?
"Poor ukrainians, we need to send more weapons to them!"
That’s retaliation of Ukraine striking long range missile in to Russian territory
Russia has to write a defend itself
Zelenskyy needs to surrender. And the Ukraine need to realize that Ukraine has been infiltrated by Israel
Blame your comedian President
who or what was the target there? surely not some random missile into some random street which did barely any damage? who did they kill?
I thought the Ukrainians shot down all the missiles
"What a psychopath, a child kidnapping criminal psycho that needs to be in jail."
"There is no doubt that against the Geneva convention. Ukraine had air defence systems hidden within those schools and hospitals. Ukraine, prompted by their puppet masters the US report this as Russian aggression. The Western propaganda is sad. If only you would report the truth of this conflict to the world, public opinion would be very much in favour of Russia."
Russia behaves it like Iran:targeting inocent civillian areas!
&quotLet the missiles speak for themselves &quot
"Hehehe, go cry to Uncle Sam."
Come on you bombed moscow 2 days ago. Stop crying foul cuz you literally asked for this.
"ahh war is so cruel there, people attacking citys, people freezing in moskow when worst tempereatures will come ahh eheh"
All You Have To Do Is SURRENDER To Mother RUSSIA....
"Africa and the Muslim world stands with Russia, its armed forces, leadership and citizens in their righteous defense against western imperialism aggressions and provocations"
Where is the cry of genocide?
"Zelensky said, the missiles will speaks for themselves then Putin sent missiles to Ukraine."
If u fooled by the west That s what u get.
"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Parker S. Huntington"
This is what you get to mess with Russia. Stupid Ukraine
Where is Nato air defenses? It seems that western weapons are useless
It is about time that Ukraine leveled the battle field.
"Why would an assassination of a warmongering general of the aggressive country be worth any more than the numerous Ukrainian civilians assaulted and butchered, some of whom were executed up close with video proof. This is ridiculous how Russia is playing victim while they are the evil"
"Pigs Can t Fly, but They Can Probably Feel Pain .. ."
"Ukraine with NATO’s blessing continues carrying out terrorists attacks against Russian officials. Russia has the right to defend itself and its citizens. Imagine, Mexicans assassinating an American General! What would happen?"
"GOD bless Russia,Glory to Russia in jesus mighty name Amen)(?"
"The cause and foundation of the problem is italy and France Paris,Rome,Napolitano,Napoli,America, Rome,Taranto,Torino,Sardegna??,,,,"
Exactly how stupid are russians that leave flowers for a scum war criminal?
"russia attacks innocent Ukraine infrastructure, apartments, churches, schools. Ukraine kills a military target. And russia complains?"
"This is so strange, he was promised to get $100K but instead he decided to tell everyone that he was hired by Ukraine and will now probably face death sentence...and what kind of dumb assasin is that to kill someone only on a promise of a reward?!"
"Russians, Palestinians are the same. Starting trouble, then play victim."
Al jazeera is cnn of middle East
"More importantly, how is the scooter? Will it recover?"
Putin is a victim when subjected to his own behavior. He assassinates political opponents in other countries when war isn t even involved.
Scooter has aright to defend itself against stupid Russians.
so do they still have on Ukraine Power Up energy drink the so called i have to recharge my battery
People in glass houses should not throw chemical weapons. When you live by the sword......
"Israel Advisement is too much,I don t think if they can do anything without western powers,"
Those flying washing machines can do a lot of damage if fired at the right angle.
At least Hitler hasn t complained by the League of Nations about assassination of his generals
America and Ukraine Provoked Russia. Russia invasion was illegal
"What Russia did today in an attack on the embassies of the 6 countries residing in Ukraine and the attack on residential buildings and basic facilities is unjustified. This country s ambsaddors are : Palestine 🇵🇸 , Portugal 🇵🇹 , North Macedonia, 🇲🇰 , Albania 🇦🇱, Montenegro 🇲🇪, Argentina 🇦🇷 it is a real violation of the peace initiative that Ukraine presented to Russia. What is truly regrettable is the attack on the embassy of the State of Palestine in Ukraine, which it claims Russia is defending the rights of its people and the injustice they are currently facing. Our greeting with UKRAINE and their people in this difficult time. 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦"
Russia: only I am allowed to unalive important people in another country. This is not fair! China: Same! The rest of the World:
Russia is a terrorist state led by Putler the wanted war criminal.
Don t start wars and play the victim. Get back to Russia and things will be peaceful.
"The West and Ukraine doing what they taught ISIS aka HTS in Russia, pure terrorists tactics"
Putin reminds me off Hitler 
I wonder how many pills did butcher Assad slip into dictator Putiin’s pocket before the horror show?
Putin going to his targets while western backed media satisfies their fans.
Lol westerners are not gonna like this.The rebels already made a deal with Russia.Arabs will never trust Israel over Russia.Because the US does nothing to stop Israel.They do whatever they want.

Dobbiamo vedere se I siriani si schiereranno con la Russia che li a massacrati insieme ad Assad ho con l’Occidente
Russia lost in Ukraine and Syria.
Putin appears far from reality ukraine war created economic crises in Russia however reduced Russia s influence with overseas leaders who admitted his failure we want to say Russia failed all it was supposed to start the war there is territory for Russia still going fighting Sometimes Ukraine tantalizes conduct assassination inside Russia
Urah president Putin 
Vladmir Run Away Putin
Russian soldiers die in the front-line and their king putler is talking about excitement from his palace in Moscow. Putin just lost Syria and the middle east.
Putin will pay for his crimes committed against the Syrian people
Both elensky and putin are sxieynœstz.
"good indication of how democratic countries should engage with its citizens. When will leaders in the USA, UK, Germany, France etc. make time to engage with their citizens in the way that Putin does?"
Putin helped Assad butcher Syrians. Those Russian bases will never be safe in Syria.
Not good at all 
Russia is just as weak as the U.S.
"It was a covert operation of CIA, Kiev claiming responsibility of it is a mere fake facade.."
There s no way that Mr green t-shirt doesn t know. Why he turn to terrorism warfare. Is Zelensky scared He gonna become scared for the rest of his life
Wrath is his name together with his accomplishes 
This smells kosher to me.
Wake-up stupid Russia is dreaming sleeping like a fools everyday Wake-up Russia
People around the world believe who killed ? 1/ Zelensky 2/ NATO military
The Americans will definitely be making a movie from this
Why his sicurity was lile Iranians?
I forgot to send greetings from Salisbury
West is sacrificing Ukrainians for their own political agenda. I do not believe west has any empathy towards human life other than their own kind
"Scapegoat story is 100% fake news, released with footage of actors to make the story seem legit so they can hide their incompetence."
Russia need to update its security.
What is really interesting is that this was NOT his place of residence....lmao
BS..... thats a scapegoat..they cant have people thinking they can be touched with impunity. poor guy.
Russia should ban uzbek in russia
Wagner too is a suspect
UK is also a suspect
Chemicals that make you sleep doesn’t sound horrific. Israel and US use white phosphorus.
Russian saying they arrested someone to try and save face I say it s bullshit.. Russian go as far as making an interigation video to try and make it look real..
"The FSB doesn t play around, Zelensky should be worried because they let him live because they wanted to."
Russians are very cruel.
"russia is filled with people disenfranchised and disillusioned with the putin regime, so finding allies is probably easy"
"one poor beggar living in the road side is a victim ,this is russian law"
"It was clear from the get-go of this assassination that Russian officials would immediately detain and present A suspect. It was also clear that this most likely would not be THE suspect but some poor scapegoat. I mean, it s Russia - what else do you expect?"
"Here is what probably happened. Poor Uzbek guy was a delivery man and all he did was to park the electric scooter. Then he was arrested, tortured thus confessed to killing the general. EDIT for context: In Russia people use Yandex delivery for everything. If you are lazy or its too cold, you call Yandex delivery and they take whatever you want to wherever you wanted. Most of the times, central asian (Uzbek, Tadjik, Kyrgyz, etc.) immigrants work in deliveries because it pays little."
alex you foul of liers you england dock..
they just catch a man and say its him and he confest to it and say its ukraine.
"Poor suspect was probably sleeping in his bed miles away when the explosion occurred.., but hey, it s a suspect and he will be found guilty 100%"
scapegoat... they just picked up the first central Asian guy they could find....
"Big Satan is the US, Little Satan is Israel!"

Actually Erdogan is a Vulture waiting to gobble up the remains. Putin is Far more of what you see is what you get. Western press has Vilified the man .... for Years. Cuz he s a Russian
"To whom it may concern Proud of the state of the world, do you think the world is special and exclusive to you? O you who take pride in the temporary blessings and state of the world, do you think that the world is reserved for you and handed over to you? When did the world cease to be a state of the greedy, do you think that your essence is necessary for this world? When did this world become devoid of the greedy, do you think that you are so necessary to this world? The most unexpected discovers the secrets of your inner world, Do you think that everyone is blind and the world is stupid? The most unexpected discovers your inner face, Do you think that everyone is blind and the people are stupid? One day you will also be miserable, O rosebud, do you think that this society is eternal? One day you too will be miserable, Oh rosebud, do you think this community will always be like this [with you]? If I were to be shameless to the king, do you think that you and I would be sad? If I were to be a coward, if I were to be grateful to this wheel (cycle), do you think that I would be saddened by your cruelty? The helper of the one who trusts in Allah is God, The unhappy heart will one day be happy. The helper of the one who trusts in Allah is Allah, The sad heart will one day be happy.

"Mucho cacarear pero ninguno habéis hecho nada ni OTAN,ni ONU,nadie tidos mirando al otro lado mucho hablar y no actuar por miedo el balor el coraje es y lo tiene IRÁN menos mal dejad qué aga lo que debe hacer y hacerse no os metais ahora gracias y gracias IRÁN 😮😊"
"People who read the holy bible know Russia 🇷🇺 and turkey 🇹🇷 are joining with Iran 🇮🇷,"
"After Iran falls, only Turkiye, and the infidels in the House of Saud remain to be conquered."
"Ezekiel 48 tells us God will win the battle, not russia,iran,turkey"
Putin thinks he s a world leader...he cant even keep his own corner of the world peaceful
I aint fighting in this war... Lock me up
Erdogan always gets the anti -Israel propaganda out when he wants to manipulate his voters and get elections closer.
"The saying, &quothave the right to defend themselves&quot says everything about the mentality of inferiority."
Hasnt PuZin been stabbed in back more than once by Retjep the last treachery was breaking a promise 2 to hand over VOZA 2 Voldermort
"Please refrain from calling islamic Republic Iran, these scum backs are not iranian, they are bunch of arab"
"Ardeghan you are next, shut the front door"
"Alas, russia is spent. Unless..."
"Erdogan, champion in empty words"
2 big mouth guy don’t align yourself with these two they will sell you look the other war. Putin disappointed me
Diplomacy isn’t possible with Netanyahu
"Iron dome: Excuse me, I cannot work under pressure"
Russia is crazy. Stop your war before you comment on another war
We don’t want an age old civilization being decimated by some newly formed countries who wanted to rewrite history not by their contribution to the world but by suppressing others.
"kim say,from trump came he has not mentioned him yet hahahaa&quotrunning scared the little rocket man jibe,realize"
USA is about to go bye bye.
All talk does nothing. They should support Iran just like the us is supporting israel
How can Putin talk about peace when he is trying to take over Ukraine?
At least Russia and Turkey agree while our President escalates.
Putin...the best of all time.
Said a guy who did not use diplomacy with Ukraine
Putin and nethanyahu both have great relationship both doing same work
Putin is a half Jew himself!
I hope Iran allies supply them with effective modern equipments because Iran helped them in their battles with drones not just lip service
Diplomacy with satan yahu !!! Get real
"Who cares what these two clowns have to say? They are completely irrelevant. When US and Israel flattens Teheran in next couple of hours, they will give two &quotstrong&quot statements and Arabs will become silence as the bottom of the ocean"
Even Russia do not want nuclear Iran.
"&quotThe presidents of Turkiye and Russia have held a phone call discussing the latest developments in the conflict between Iran and Israel. Both leaders agreed that diplomacy must bring the fighting to an end as soon as possible&quot. Putin, Diplomacy? Yeh right! Two of the world s greatest tyrants are now preaching diplomacy to the world, and typically, the media give them lots of airtime!"
So dictator ayatola khamenie begging erdogan and poutin to stop israel
Turkish leader erdogan he is nt muslim he is mixing person he seitan that s why Turkish people must be change the leader erdogan is puppet
This women are bias Putin and iran are very good friend they has been friends for long time it not for putin political gain putin iran china all are not interested in war only setanyahoo usa west love war so what political gains if it peace
Diplomacy failed. Isreal is not playing this time. Russia has its problems with Ukraine.
We have to live in a world where Putin and Erdogan are peacemaker
Before peace talk all menber must remove lawless law body and all country must build international laws U.N criminal law thats serve justice equality humanity. If not dont waste time lawless law
"Turkey’s erdogan is disgraceful to Muslim ummah ,he’s a supporter of evil "
RUSSIA MUST WITHDRAW FROM UKRAINE AND CYPRUS WHILE TURKEY MUST LEAVE CYPRUS BOTH OCCUPYING POWER AND OCCUPYING FORCES ILLEGAL UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND U.N CHARTER.
Erdogan is just a talker. This guy has not done anything in the whole Gaza conflict.
I-ran trying to run away from its problems
Russia doesn’t want Iran wasting their drones.
Iran is begging for mercy
Erdogan is a double edged sword. He can t be trusted at all.
But Turkiye and Russia are afraid of Israel s might
Turkey is all talk and King Abdullah from Jordan is a coward.
Os americanos causaram isso pra fazer o Irã se opor a suas regras acho que poderia controlar a guerra na Ucrânia putin continua a tomar e tomar mais território é tomar a decisão certa
Sadly there is no sane voice left anymore. In earlier times it was India which would bring countries together because everyone respected them but now India too is in the pockets of Israel. Russia is compromised too. China has been a big disappointment. It’s an emerging superpower and yet it doesn’t act like one. It should have given the world an alternate but it failed to do so. Turkey is all words no action. It has sold its soul like the Arab kingdoms. It’s a sad state of affairs. Dark days ahead for humanity.
One talker another bustard
ISRAEL N@zis attacked Iran 1st. Iran has the Power and Right to defend itself
It s d matter of transgressor trangrress beyond bounds
why are they talking of diplomacy when they can even solve the wars they started? they even not in the position to be the person to talk when it comes to diplomacy.
Turkey no action talk only..we saw what you do at palestinian
Diplomacy. Hahaha. Any ceasefire without the overthrow of the Iran government put the mossad at risk
When she said international sanction that mean the West The West is what they call the world the west is what they call the civilized world remember what the European president called the outside world Europe is the basket so where is this journalism and this export about Russia Iran come from who are these people that know the history they just born That s a young woman
"Freedom &amp justice to Palestine, Iran. ignore hasbara, paid bots and trolls"
"In a world of injustice, iran is a beam of hope"
"Only problem for Iran is that there own allied can t help them like USA, uk, Germany,france e.t.c will help Israel."
Too late for that! US birds incoming and Regime change now! The paper tiger has fallen!
Turkey is next after Iran. The islamist regime of Erdogan is in danger
"Whothefuckis Erdogan? Putin you say ok, but the other 1d1ot? I don t think so"
Nothing to do only for i Wash
The zionist are the alien invation the world has been talking about.
How does two bullies talk about diplomacy? Hypocrisy of the highest order.
two dictators for life
The only language Nazinyahu knows is violence
The most stupid and useless Presidents
Ever wonder if Iran got their hands on the Epstein Files when they took all those Israeli secret files. I mean there sre millions of files belonging to Mossad and other Israeli agencies. There has to be something about Epstein in there!
"This two guys has no ccks. No balls. Shame to see iran having to deal alone with enemies. No balls with russia, china turkey, northkorea. Failure in geopolitics. Shame on you."
Putin is a war criminal and is doing the same to Ukraine
There is no diplomacy with terrorism. Israel is a terrorist state.
"If russofascists killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than zionazis killed Palestinian children, does that mean that russia is four times less fascist than israel?"
"I think Russia and a lot of other oil producing companies, love what’s going on oil will go higher and that Will enrich they pocket at the end of the day. They don’t care about children and innocent people dying. It’s always about the money. Russia supposed to be partners with Iran why are they not helping Turkey never helps anyone in the Middle East if anything they help Israel."
"Both this guys are always concerned, but do nothing about the genocide in Palestine or anyone else "
"I m an American veteran, and i haven t seen a war so easy by taking over another country air space. The Iranian regime should be a shame of themselves they are worth less, they have no military strategy whatsoever."
No one is coming to Iran s rescue with this war. They spent years building destabilizing proxy groups to threaten Israel with and now that they re all neutralized they are vulnerable and everyone knows it.
I feel bad for turkiye people why vote for such horrible president
"By all respect mr Erdogan, in this cases u are speaking nonsense. Diplomacy was there and mr Netanyahu have use that to plan this attacks. So how will be your reaction if this have make to you Israel ?"
"Actually, Russia and Turkiye are supporting Iran against Israel in the diplomatic way, although it s not so obvious. Trump helped Russia a lot in the Russo-Ukrainian war by stopping the military aids to Ukraine, and Turkiye is even a member of Nato, therefore, both Mr Putin and Mr Erdogan wouldn t help Iran so obvious in order to avoid stimulating America, and that s understandable"
"Pootin can only talk, he proved to be useless."
Turkey are snakes. Scumbags.
"Iran helped russia when the entire west stood against him seeing him quite after iran been attacked is mind blowing, Mr putin after all kamikaze drone from iran you can t supply iran even with single anti air craft interceptor"
Yes Putin doesn’t want Israel to damage his terror drone operations against Ukraine.
But Putin should stay away from this. He s busy harassing his neighbor but want peace talks with distant people.
Putin don’t trust Hypocrite Edrogan who is NATO member
Russia is being useless
Aljazeera is hunting for supports for Iran. The world knows that Aljazeera is the number one hater of Israel. Aljazeera can t stop Israel from defending itself.
"Europe united, but the Middle East didn’t — so they re being targeted one by one: first Palestine, now Iran, next could be Saudi Arabia, and eventually the entire region."
"So isnotreal , america and other wsetern countries can gave nuclear program but iran cant really hypocritical statement"
"There is no diplomatic cure or solution to the expansionist, neo-colonist, ethno-supremacist, financial and resource-greed aspirations of the West (inclusing Israel, North America, UK, wesern Europe, Australia and New Zealand)."
watermelon seller keeps talking empty words
Turkey is responsible for what is happening in Middle East.
These two dumbasses phone each other.
Has being a mediator ever worked?
Diplomacy don’t work against Israel the US and the UK while Russia china Iran turkey and arab countries go for diplomacy the west including Israel is trying to destroy the world 1 country at a time
Turkiye only talks talks n talks . Help iran militarily
Aur do gann*?
Stop genocidal state
Russia needs to stop its own war. As for Turkey there is no love lost between Iran and Turkey.
This reporting makes me yawn. This is a big nothing burger.
"Aljazeera is promoting Israel from the beginning, very clear by their news and inviting guests. Your time will come one day as you re promoting Israel crime."
It seems Russia invested a lot in Iran and doesn t want the demolition to continue
Iran coward muslim countries leaders are licking the boots of US and its western allies
Putin the peacemaker
Erdogan only talk no action  ali khamenei only action no talk
This lady seems very naive. Putin will display a desire for a diplomatic solution publicly but behind the scenes he will try to fuel the conflict in hopes of diverting Western resources and efforts away from Ukraine. Those who don t see that are blind.
"Erdogan and Putin talking about mediating and sovereignty, oh what a joke X)"
Russia just has to make sure that America stays out of this.
"Turkey government Erdogan No Muslim should trust this double-faced Erdogan, he only tells lies to save his government, American Dog Erdogan"
Be baptised by full emersion and receive receive gift of the holy spirit speaking in tongues
"Israel doesn’t want diplomacy cos Iran was already in diplomatic talks with USA when isreal attacked them, so why are they still talking about this diplomacy. Hypocrite people."
Erudugan is frustrated
The bully aka Israeli nazism must be penalised
No diplomacy for the one who attacking!!
"Turkey is a hypocrite, and Russia is a traitor. Talk is cheap"
Putin shouldn t say anything he shouldn t be among the people speaking peaceful resolution bse themselves they have refused cease fire in Ukraine.
"Erdogan is a stabber camaleon. He can t be trusted. Russia has to be careful with that opportunistic who would betray anybody. He doesn t embrace real friends somehow he has isolated himself in his bargaining game. He would love to be treated like a little king but the west hates him. Russia and China have been patient with this fool but they know he can snitch on them once offered more money. There will come a time when he has to side with someone but he will do like coward Spanish Franco who played both side leaning towards Hitler but a total coward. At the end, because of him, Spain was left out from the UN power share. The britz would love to sink Erdogan s ego because they hate him and his nation as much as they hate Russia. Time will tell."
Okay mr Putin then go make peace with Ukraine first...or are you just as hypocrite as his zionist masters
Turkey should decide either support iran or Israel not playing games
Two cowards
Moscow just needs to shutup and deal with their own problems.
Diplomacy is death
Bible prophecy unfolding minute by minute. The Lamb reigns victorious! 
Russia talking about diplomacy? Wow!
"Nations talk about diplomacy, Trump talk about a deal. Just like any business, Trump Mobile launched!"
Is erdogan a zios’ muppet?
"BiBi knows his political career would end, if he fails to win this war. So, he tries to drag Trump into the fray with False claims about &quotTrump Assassination Bid&quot"
"Turkey shivered badly witnessing isreal s precise and deadly response claiming top islamic regime officials from intelligence, military i bet Erdogan would peed in his trouse if this happened between isreal and turkey"
Allah is helping israel control Iranian air space
Iran has the right to defend.
Both of these rats can f off. peace throw what not being alive.
Israel doesn t understand diplomatic language because America is main devil behind to keep hold in Middle Eastern oil.
Not sure Russia is the best choice for mediator here.
"Israel’s actions are causing many problems, and without stopping them, peace is not possible. Russia, China, and Turkey should now stand beside Iran and offer support in this difficult time."
"They aren t talks about diplomacy. They re talks about the next excallation, strategy-coordination, and jump in."
"Most of y’all in the comments, don’t make sense. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. We’re all pretending like Iran is a good country so let’s just stop that first of all, and on top of that Iran is ran by terrorist group. We all know that to be true too they use fear That’s their number one tactic and that’s how they stay in control. Do y’all really want Iran to have a nuclear weapon? On top of that, how is Russia is going to try to hold peace talks between Iran and Israel and they can’t even solve their own problem with Ukraine. It makes no sense for you to sit up here and say hey let me lead the talks between Israel and Iran and you can’t even come up with an agreement with Ukraine. It makes no sense. Focus on that first. The only reason why they probably want to hold the talk is because they benefit from Iran! they need Iran oil for their war and weapons"
this is supposed to be relevant news? What diplomacy? Putin doesn t use dimplomacy in his own war but wants to mediate for Iran and Israel? There is no reason for Iran to accept and forgive Israel s behavior
"Most of y’all in the comments, don’t make sense. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.

But they can t do the same thing for Palestinians hypocrites leaders with double standards
Iran is Great power full 
Innocent people of iran stay safe ... the world with you... it s not your fault that your government put you in this position
"We don t know if Rusia is helping Iran, I hope they help them, because the Jews get help from US, UK, France and Iranian are just fitting alone, these gang is dangerous for the world."
ERdogan always wants to be a good guy. He cannot be trusted.
WHY IS THIS TERRORIST SUPPORTER NATO MEMBER TALKIN WITH PUTIN? ERDOGAN IS AN ISLAMIC TERRORIST SUPPORTER
"Israel should never take this action  This action as the starting of war , now gave Iran justifications to rally Arabs, Russia and Chinese to support. All Arab States behind the scene will side with Iran. Not smart move israel. "
"I think Iran is the most reliable ally of Russia, as Iran demonstrated in standing fully with the Russians during the Russian bad times. Iran-Russian partnership is more than military cooperation, I think. If Iran needs, Russia might even give 100s of Nuks to Iran, as Iran delivered Shahid Kamikaze drones and ballistic missiles for Russia during the bad time, when everyone ignored Russia and enemies want to erase Russia."
Imagine Netanyahu hiding in a bunker
Turkey is useless and Erdogan is a hypocrite
They are enjoying both
"F* Erdogan, only talking"
"I don t think there is a permanent solution because the US and Israel s aim was always a change of regime in Iran. The aim remains the same regardless of Iran having or not having a nuclear program. Otherwise, the previous agreement with Iran, which was limiting enrichment, was perfectly okay to resolve the problem, but it was Trump who pulled out of it following Israel s guidance."
The only country that is trustworthy in the negotiation is Oman.
Will diplomacy bring back the dead? Will it please those who were unalived? Stop lying. All these other people are just trying to convince Putin to not get involved.
Help of Erdogan and Putin never reached Gaza despite it literally turned into graveyard. Perhaps they are now also waiting for another Gaza to come up making hollow promises to Iran.
Two traitor
"thank you Israel ,im a muslim and i support Israel"
Putin must end his war in Ukraine. This looks awkward
"Iran never spoke war,Isreal always spoke war he even sold the idea of killing leaders of countries he considered enemies to their puppet Trump,Isreal want to pull the world into a world war."
Yulia shapaealoa is great girl
Russia can never be trusted. Western countries always help their friends and allies.
Putin talking about diplomacy is the bigggest joke of the year.
"Diplomacy doesn’t work with narcissistic beasts, primitive instinctive beings. "
Neranyahu does not give a hoot for the likes of Putin and Erdogan and may not even answer their phone calls.
Erdogan the empty talker and Putin the oppurtunist.
"Diplomacy does not work with Israhell. Only military power will sort this out, not diplomacy"
Erdogan is just big mouth good for nothing...the first week of attack on Gaza by Israel the first one who issued the statement was Erdogan saying death is coming to Israel anyday we will knock at your door...now two years passed thousand of innocent children and women killed in Gaza and Erdogan is still on the way...he is just a big actor on the world screen nothing more than statement..
erdogan and putin only speaking then finished no values
An Iran-supporter and an Iran-proxy walk into a bar...
israel gonna talk and then start an attack again and then play the victim card and call for its father america.
Ayatollah can join Assad in Moscow
Putin as well diplomacy against Ukraine. Fair deal
The west don t do diplomacy only evil.
"Sorrows and disgrace shall be Netanyahu s portion from today, peace will be far from him and his bloodline, every innocent Palestinian blood he spilled shall stand against him in this life and the life after for the Prophet of the most high God have called him out and reported him to the highest authority in the mighty name of Yeshua Hamashiach who the world calls Jesus Christ."
"If Trump wants the Iran-Israel conflict to end, it s simple don t send weapons to Israel."
Love to hear Macron &quotflirting around during G7
"One has Afghan and Ukrainian blood on its hands, the other Armenian — and they dare to talk about diplomacy."
"aljazzera is very unhappy... another horrible dictator is being removed. First hitler, then assad, then khamenei... poor poor aljazzeera"
So Iran wants a cease fire already? Who would have thought? Meanwhile millions of Iranians are starting to be displaced These people NEVER learn
Israel is the terrorist state
"Is genocide and starvation of children in Gaza still going on? How many residential buildings were destroyed by Israel in Gaza? How many people, including children and women, were burnt alive in Gaza by Israel? Has Israel allowed international media to be allowed to report from GAZA? Israel attacked civilians in Iran, and Iran has the right to self-defense , right?"
WHY IS TURKEY WITH NATO ?????? THEY NEED TO GTFO
No one will believe you both in Israel. Just evacuate your ally kamenei
Who the f is Erdogan he is not able to save Palestine trying to mug up everywhere who takes him seriously
Russia is getting rich off them high oil prices.
They might just help Iran
"Send them to Allah, and let him sort it all out."
I get visions of Ali Tollah and Assad walking in Moscow together - arm in arm
"And this is news worthy, why?"
They need to arrest the Netanyahu War criminal and stop the killing of both side civilians....
Fact: Russia has a large Jewish population in Israel Fact : Russia has the ability to store nuclear materials found Fact: Russia does not agree with Iran having a nuclear weapon. Fact: There is no western country that could mediate as a neutral mediator that Iran would trust. Is the goal is to find a permanent solution agreeable to all or to buy time. The issue should not be Putin. It should be peace.
Why did Turkey not arrest Putin on the world court order? Putin has an active international court order for his arrest.
"Not to trust Erdogan. He is a Munafiqin. Russian, we need to be careful, Iran now this chance will never come. Disable Israel completely . The Munafiqins Arabs will respect Iran. Font trust Modi."
Give iran time to teach israel first do not get rush 
Erdogan and Putin. Talk is cheap.
Isreal is loosing that’s why they want the fight to stop
Ironic given Putin and Erdogan’s visions of “Diplomacy”. Nevertheless we all want peace in the Middle East.
Putin is a fool and Russians should depose of him asap. If he stays in power more of humiliations like the bombers getting destroyed few weeks back are gonna happen to Russia. Remove the fool and put Medvedev in his place.
Erdogan is a yelper. Nothing more nothing less.
Erdugan. You hypocrite. May Iran be the saviour of Palestine.
Biased kathmulla Erdogan.. Turkey is a NATO member.
"Once, this joker promoted Diriliş: Ertuğrul just to boost his popularity in the Muslim world. Then Erdoğan stated his dream about to restore the Ottoman Empire after 2022 But… but… but… he forgot that he is not even good enough to perform the Turkish ice cream act!🍦"
"Very important lesson for every country and every individual to learn fast: Relationships are often about ever-changing selfish interests and rarely about selfless friendship! Saddam, Ghadaffi, Osama, Assad, etc. all learned that the hard way! Bosom friends today and mortal enemies tomorrow!"
"Turkey is a shameless country, Nobody can Trust them"
Is this a joke? Putin. Putin is asking for de-escalation? HAHAHAHA
No way Israel should be allowed to teach Iran a bitter lesson so that next time they we obey what ever decisions or proclaimanation the US give Iran must adhere to it because they had been sponsoring terrorist around the world so they can be trusted with nuclear power
" Iran has reached out to Oman and Qatar, requesting that they mediate with Washington in an effort to halt the ongoing Israeli strikes and restart nuclear talks"
Erdogan has been calling Pakistan to form alliance against Israel 🇮🇱 today what makes him pacifist?
The chosen one who god apparently has anointed king prophet and false messiah of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu is now commanding his useful idiots like America and the Americans to lay down their life’s and money for Israel once again…🤦🏼‍♂️
No diplomacy until after isnotreal has been crippled.
Israel is a bully and needs to be stopped once and for all
"The invisible sides of war: because we refuse to learn. From Hanoi to Gaza. When America entered the war in Vietnam, it stepped into a conflict it didn’t understand. No grasp of the people. No grasp of the land. No idea how deeply rooted resistance can be when a nation is defending its home. Today, we see echoes of that same miscalculation. Putin believed Ukraine would fall in days. Netanyahu flirts with the idea that regime change in Tehran—by killing a few key leaders—could be swift and surgically successful. But war doesn’t unfold in straight lines. In Vietnam, the more bombs America dropped—B-52s, Napalm bombs , carpet bombing—the more resilient the Vietnamese became. It happened again in Iraq. Again in Afghanistan. The “mother of all bombs” was dropped. And still, more Afghans rose and won. From that wreckage came the Taliban. Came ISIS. Ghosts of wars that were meant to be won. Because here’s the hard truth: A foolish leader starts a war first—and calculates the cost later. War fueled by its own ashes. Victory on the battlefield it doesn t mean winning the war. And without that… the war is never truly over….."
Unprovoked attacks...
"Ezekiel 38And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 2 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 3 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: 4 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords: 5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them all of them with shield and helmet: 6 Gomer, and all his bands the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee. 7 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them. 8 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them. 9 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee. 10 Thus saith the Lord GOD It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought: 11 And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, 12 To take a spoil, and to take a prey to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land. 13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants"
Erdoğan always trying his best for peace
Why Turkey has become Turkiye? Turkiye is not in English language
Don t meddle. No diplomacy needed here.
"You both sent deadly weapons to Iran not a lesson,,,,, And declaire freedom of Palestine GHAZA Witg broke seige of GHAZA,,,,,"
Putin and Erdogan fear their partners are destroyed
Better than Macron Starmer and the german one. Much better
How many Russians was killed wirh American weapons Putin should wake up China more loyal and recognize danger of American friendships.
Russia ignoring Iran for their temporary gain.they don’t even blast Israel verbally after sending of patriots to Ukrain.if russia want to oppose US hegomony they hv to strengthen Iran with air defences not with words
Erdogan is a coward
No diplomacy works with the anthrax of the Middle East
Russia would have a big problem in the Caspian sea if it lets the devil west take Iran...
"We need to make a quick decision to stop the war, not just by talking on the phone."
Every country needs to back off and let Iran deal with Israel. US stay out of this conflict. IRAN can resolve this on their own. maybe then Israel will think long and hard before declaring war on a sovereign nation.
"Tesla batteries suck, never buy a Tesla"

"Turkey had enough of Putin’s nonsense. As soon as a cease fire is called, Turkey will enter Ukraine, war will permanently stop. Or Turkey will help Ukraine crash Putin. Poopin. No more Iran-Russia. Israel and US will break up Russia - Iran. There’s no one left in Iran to negotiate"
NOW they are recommending diplomacy? A little late fellas.
If usa shows no sign of invasion fine with me no invasion of iran khaimenei must be respected PERIOD he acted after provocation from Israel
Russia first end up barrage of war on Ukraine
This is big Iran

UN has the last word. If it s deemed illegal then it is.
"Putin should not talk about peacetalks, he do exactly the same as israel"
"As a Turkish man, firs I don t support Ishraels biggest dog Erdoğan. Second I am ashamed of the false muslim King and third please forgive me my Palestinian brothers and sisters for what Türkiye didn t do."
Endogan is slow in delegation like a leech he also walk same way
I think the only solution is the occupiers must leave.
"Erdogan is a liar, Munafik Iran needs military support, weapons, not talks Kafir"
"As I agree with Russia, I do not think their words hold as much weight anymore"
This all war in middle east sponsor amerecan derty evill policy only. But all Arab leaders are same like a GAY GAY GAY MORE THEN 100 YEARS. SHAME ON ALL ARAB LEADERS SPEALY SAUDI KING SHAIKA SALMAN.

"What a joke - psychopath Putin who ordered the Russian attack and invasion of Ukraine is calling for &quotdiplomacy&quot between Israel and Iran. The whole idea is insane, and an insult to the intelligence of the human race. What kind of fools do you take us for?"
2025 world empty president in erdogan. Erdogan only can drama to all world. Still now don t do anything to QAZA and all world. Maby erdogan mental person?
netanyahu is a wanted war criminal who is going to use nuclear weapons on Iran and netanyahu must be stopped.
It is clear that Israel has become the most powerful terrorist organization in the Middle - East
The Iranian are shaking up The Israeli air force are flying all over Iran without any.... Israel going on the regime change Bye-bye Iran
India is spreading a lot of fake news and ai generated fake videos about Pakistan turkey guys so be careful don t believe in what s been shown over India news channels
"Erdogan and Putin coming together for mediation means US/Israel are fighting a losing game. They are out to rescue US/Israel from bad entanglement.. Both are US double agents, out to cause more harm to Iran than good."
At toothless bulldog Russia bogged down in a special military operation trying to be a PEACE broker ? You can t make this up
They will not do anything.
"Turkiye, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and for many other Islamic countries, Iran was a headache because of its military might and economic growth. No doubt they playing double games!"
How Iran is destroying Israel and making Gaza
I wish I had friends like Iran
That offer to moderate sounds like them saying they arent going to provide any support
People of turkey needs to drag Erogan out of his power. Useless coward
Erdogan such a p*ssy
Can you believe that dictator and aggressor like putin is saying diplomacy is needed.
"PUTIN, YOU CANNOT TRUST ERDOGAN!!!!!"
Mr Putin &amp Mr Erdogan &amp Mr Jinping are the greatest leaders of this era Much Love for Mother Russia... Don t agree ? You don t know enough or brainwashed
This wouldn’t have happened if Trump was President
"This punishment of God bb do you think what did you do with servants of God in Palestine, Labnan,Syria,... God saved Moses in the house of Pharaon. Please save yourself from the fire of God. No one can t benefit you ... except God last Guidance and Religion İslam!!"
Erdogan boss
Iran needs military support not talks
Iran to the world: How can she slap?!?!
Russians get VERY upset when their lies are not believed.
News media play important role in conveying unbiased messages to the world. Misinformation and propaganda lead to continuation of war.
Stop lying its zeleski n his master s nato n us!! Ukrainians r dying while zeleski s wife is shopping in Milan Paris n London!! Russia has destroyed all nato n us tech weapons!!! B carefuL the oreshnik will visit al nato countries  who is going to stop Russia!!???
Russia and Ukraine need only one thing: That s peace agreement with no foreign influence.
"To be fair, Ukrainian people have NO ACCESS TO non NATO mainstream media.. they have been brainwashed. There is no reason for banning Russian media sources unless the Ukraine government and NATO government are afraid of narratives which challenges the NATO/Ukraine narrative"
"Ukraine won’t even pay for there dead soldiers, disgraceful, what incentive do Ukraine’s have to fight when there own government declares there sacrifice worthless"
"Russia is currently taking 5 miles a day, lollllllllllllll these idiots are a disgrace"
Watching these shows with the ridiculously skewed views and narratives lacking any publicly available facts and stated formal positions incl. strategic directions. Anyone can see both sides of the conflict. These people onpy choose to see one side.
Wheres the evidence that Russia was losing 1000 men a day? This is Western propaganda.
Western propaganda at its best. The casualties are the opposite of what you report - up to 1.2 million Ukrainians and 200 thousand Russians
"The boring old meat grinder bs again, the retarded never read the room"
Did I just hear right the Ukranian man mentioned that Russia has lost around 1.4 million soldiers and Ukraine only tens of thousand when discussing payment for fallen soldiers... What reverse world are these guys living in?
Russia had to send its bots here because apparently they’re marching down Kyiv parade style
"Weldone Ama Boateng,greetings from Ghana 🇬🇭"
"Ukraine must rally Western troops to defend themselves, otherwise they’re DOOMED."
"Russia had 180,000 soldiers on the beginning of the war. After recruiting and training, they had a maximum of 1 million army in Ukraine . According to Ukraine and pro-ukraine sources, they lost 1million solders. Why is war still going on if Ukraine is so successful killing almost the entire Russian army on the battle field."
AJ no credibility left with these &quotexperts&quot(liars ) and the silence on the terror reign in Syria
"Can you stop with the usual pro-war speakers? fed up with S Erlanger, he is fossil working for Washington. None of them make sense at this point. Some names for you: Jeffrey Sachs, Glenn Diesen, John Mearsheimer, any Ukrainian opposition leader, Aaron Mate, Gilbert Doctorow, Alistair Crook"
This so called analysts forget that people or the audience watching have access to other sources of information. I think it’s foolish and speaks more the credibility of the person when spewing random numbers in the hope it will advance a narrative to favour one side.
"This is really pointless and waste of time, all 3 speakers on the panel were in agreement and had the same viewpoints in favour of Ukraine and against Russia. I thought Aljazera will provide a balanced perspective and discussion relative to all the other shows from DW, France 24 and others from EU and US, but I was wrong. Even for the most lame and uninformed person would conclude to be a therapeutical discussion in support of Ukraine."
1% THOROUGHLY pacified...meaning never coming back to zelensky....
"DO NOT EXPECT that---it was the kremlin that made the occupation when it retired it s veto in the age when there was NO Afrikan or Asian voices, the Moscowvite SSRs persistently voted to transfer europeans from, Europe to another colony they even forgot that they themselves had a policy under JAO. I can tell you now, categorically that the kremlin will NOT sit-back and watch the dismantling of the Caspian entente at the behest of their great western rivals. However, the puny occupation under the non interference terms, can still defend herself... this has always been the agreed rule, but Moscow NEVER played fair, and consistently betrayed the Arabs courtesy of the paradigms of JAO, but, ever since 1991 the Kremlin is under no foundational illusions, it will not butter the western colonial toast...."
"God have mercy on the Ukrainians. We know there is nothing difficult before God, since God has witnessed wars since time immemorial and stopped many many He intervene this time in Ukraine"
"Aljazeera editor and director please you guys credibility is at risk, we are all for the under dog, but you can t be impartial on Gaza and become very partial on Russia-Ukraine war, any viewer would detect the propaganda, bring equal analyst from each side, and don t be repeating Nato Ukraine propaganda."
America deceived Ukraine. Russia will take Ukraine if America fails to correct this mistake.
Ho are dose people? I day have not clo what is going on in Russia or Ukraine Way day not say NATO AMERICA against Russia
Extremely stupid propaganda.
Russia honestly disappointed some of us who initially thought was a big super power country.
The figures she started with 1 million dead russians were enough for me to stop the video. bullshit propaganda
The moment you say Russia lost more than Ukraine. Then you know this is just silly propaganda
"Those figures from the West are wrong, it s just propaganda, we saw bodies handed to Ukraine yesterday."
Aljazeera is the most useless and nonsensical media In the planet  anyone listing tho them is doing himself harm because they are full of lies and misleading masses. They have done more harm than good to this planet.
Al jazeera is fully biased now.
This is not enough for Zelensky and he’s going to lose more of his friends and supporters
MACGREGGOR GAVE A DIFGFERENT NUMBERS MORE THE OTHER WAY ROUND.
These are C I A agents and not analysts. Shame on aljazeera.
Where did you get that clown reporting from Moscow?
Propaganda will not help naztzi Europe. This no media platform but a lying shir.
Stupid lying media bringing cia agents as analyst. Morons on media.
Once aljazeera stasttr partitioning Ukraine British lies about number of Russian soldiers dead i know that very soon they will be another ghost media known only fort stupidity.
Russian suffered 1m and Ukraine 400k. Thats why no one believed main stream media today. They just call numbers without thinking or someone gave you a paper to read from and ran with it
"Qatar is a lackey of the US, so AJ is spewing Western perspective, not Russian. The casualties are 1.5 million Ukrainians and Russia has 120k, the opposite of what AJ is reporting. Russia is fighting entire NATO, not just Ukraine. This war was triggered by the US, using Ukraine as a proxy, to weaken Russia then break it up like USSR, in order to steal its vast natural resources. The second objective of the war is to deprive China of an ally in subsequent war on the Chinese. The aim is to stop the nascent world order led by BRICS, thru Russia and China. Ukrainian oligarchs and elites are being paid for their service with billions in aid ."
"Ukraine Was Begging For This. You Want It You Got It! And That s Just The Beginning, The Worst Has Yet To Come!"
Aljazeera losing all credibility over this war. Because you are leaning towards Europe and Ukraine.
"NATO CHIEF once SAID IN 2023 that Russia was running out of weapons , In 2025 Russia is STILL FIGHTING without any insufficiency of weapons ANOTHER E.U CLOWN said Russia is using chips from Dish washers, FROM refrigerators to make weapons "
"UKRAINE is losing land , military PERSONNELS, infrastructure etc"
This is a bad journalism unexpected from Aljazeera! What is the point of having a discussion between three anti-Russian/ pro-western/Ukrainian guys? Was it a debate or a friendly discussion?
As media Russia million Ukraine 100 Do believe it?
Fallen Soldiers and families have to be deserving fully Respected 
"If you are going to tell Ukraine where Russian troops are and where to aim, then it is not the Ukraine which is doing the job. The contradiction in this analysis is hilarious."
1000 in a day my goodness. How s Russia able to sustain such looses.
Nice exercise in disinformation.
(PRO)WESTERN WAR MANIACS
"Uncritically stating western claims of casualty figures and using the western talking point that it’s “Russias full scale war on Ukraine.” I expect much better of Aljazeera. I’d like Ukraine to win the conflict too but 190,000 troops in 2022 is not a full scale invasion and to ignore the nuances and background of this war is irresponsible. Couldn’t watch past the 6 minute mark. This is propaganda."
When both sides tired and realized they made mistakes. Peace will prevail.
Liars fake analysis
"Why did aljazeera assembled only pro-Ukrainian panel, including the one they claimed was speaking from Moscow for this program?"
"Aljazeera propaganda here defy logic, over a million death Russian soldiers, how many soldiers do they have in in arms?"
"putin should stop his being EVIL, his EVIL AMBITION and his EVIL INVASION OF SOVEREIGN UKRAINE."
"As long as Zelensiky is a Ukraine leader and some European leaders has contributed to use Ukraine a bet to weaken Russia, WWIII is eminent, trust me."
"I think you owe us the number of casualties of Ukraine too, but you keep talking about the failures of the Russians while keeping silent about the other side."
"Man, dont ever critize any regime in ANY country, unless you already have experiences in managing and lead a country. Look into the mirror. One more thing. Doing research is better than reading news."
Russia is winning hands down despite what this FALSE NEWS channel is trying to portray
🇺🇦Ukraine is loosing everything 
🇷🇺Russia is won against 50 fascist countries ...
"Question to European colonizers: If Russia is so losing in Ukraine, why are you so scared then?"
"Propaganda don t win a war. Lie all you want about casualties, the reality is telling the truth on ground. And today Ukraine is too embarrass to back 6000 bodies their soldiers because of the many lies they kept feeding about casualties."
That man is not a Russian he was paid to come on this news channel
"Peter Zalmayev better says what he says so that he is not dragged into military service by force. The Ukranians are always more one sided in their opinion than Russian guests. Doesn t look like a vivid democracy, certainly not a country that we should welcome to the EU."
"Russia also has a manpower shortage from a declining population, brain drain of young talented people, and insufficient workers. Aside from that its military equipment is severely depleated."
"painfull listening to your propaganda and by the way where do you get those figures from,?? Ukraine ofcourse.propaganda at worst"
"Russia a million Ukraine 4 hundreds, why why , but is not your fault is the work of the media propagandist devil s vampires blood sucker s western puppet, shame on you lier."
"For Zelensky, It does not matter even if all Ukranians be killed or all of Ukraine be destroyed. Zelensky is an Israeli agent and is working for the benefit of israel. Israel s Gaza offensive is going on and Ukraine s war will stop only after israel s Gaza offensive is over. Its a well planned strategic step taken by israeli financers to keep diverting all muslim world attention, specially the caucasian muslim, who are the majority Russian soldiers fighting ukraine. Smart one will calculate and understand what I means."

BRICS and Global South will support Russia in this proxy war and who bothered about Europe warmongering posture and sanctions have failed
"Zelensky is an Israeli agent and is working for the benefit of israel. Israel s Gaza offensive is going on and Ukraine s war will stop only after israel s Gaza offensive is over.

"AJ is a BS news media, more fiction than facts. &quot1 million dead or wounded&quot this is totally BS"
Can t listen to that old man he is saying Russian gained 1% and losing a 1000 a day that Rubbish to put is on the nice way
Where is she getting the stats from Ukraine? Do you me Russia firing FABs and 10x with artillery. But has suffered a 600k more Ukraine
"What was ukraine thinking striking russias nuclear bombers at the start of peace negotiations, complete madness"
No prospects for peace with The Orange Clown in the White house. 24 hours has passed already DJT
Julia looks like a man monster
"This video really hit home for me—retirement has been such a rewarding chapter of life! My wife and I worked hard to get here, and we’re incredibly thankful for where we are today. Now we’re debt-free with a net worth over $3 million, and that investment income supports us every week. we’re enjoying the fun stuff—traveling, golfing, and spending lots of quality time with our grandkids.If you re working toward retirement, just know it’s absolutely possible with patience and a good plan!"
I can t believe am back home
What about the 6000+ Ukrainian bodies?
"Ukraine, Zelenskyy.Brave ."
"I think Zelenski is afraid of the number of corpses, as he claims that roughly 30,000 soldiers have died during this time. But essentially, anyone who has followed both sides even a little knows that this number is far, far higher !"
Poor Ukraine. They are a weak US puppet state lead by a corrupt cocaine addict who s not only beholden to the US war machine but Neo-Nazis in the shadows. Hopefully Russia can retake Ukraine fully and make it prosper under proper leadership.
"Expired Zelenskie not except receive body s , this is terrible. Expired Zelenskie alredy say, he can t take body s, because he need to pay each family big money for each died soldiers, it s 6000 there. Expired Zelenskie just get angry Ukraine family members who waited long time receive loved one..."
Ukraine had to be shamed first
"Ukrainian people didn t want or vote for war, forced into it by America &amp England....Nato France &amp Germany Zelensky a sheep being lead... To slow to pickup,its the orthodox Catholics targete, on both sides...this war is a cover...for them to achieve it Russia powerful nation, the loyalsit protestant new world order want it destroyed.."
"they are already resting in peace, but they still won t give them peace and dignity..."
"In the end Russia will prevail. And it s not my opinion, but my understanding of a biblical prophecy. What we will see is the return of the king of the north - Russia, announced in Daniel 11:29a. Jesus also referred to this event: Matthew 24:6 reads: &quotThen you will certainly hear of battles and next the sounds of battles being fought (this indicates that the current war in Ukraine will escalate). Be careful not to be afraid (this in turn indicates that this war will spread to other countries, escalating to a very dangerous form (with the use of tactical nuclear weapons cf. Am 5:8,9) for everything must come to pass (meaning: to be fulfilled - Jesus here refers to Da <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGPuqknuN_s&ampt=689"">11:29</a>a) but the fulfillment (implicitly: of the sign) is not yet there–this means that the U.S will not get directly involved in this war, and the strategic nuclear weapon will not be used yet.)&quot According to Daniel 11:29a we will see Russia (depicted as the king of the north ) RETURN. This means that Russia will again have military bases where it had in the previous century."
Nato created the Ukraine war.
I m curious as to how many American mercenaries are POW s in Russia?
They dont want to take 6k dead bodies nor their soldiers wounded or not. At list until this morning that was the case
They don t want to pay the families of the fallen solders the 300.000$ that the state promised. That s why they won t take the bodies back.
"Sad that people die for dictators rich politicians ,war crimes against Ukraine Putin needs to be stopped know."
Ukraine did not turn up to collect their dead.
Ukraine doesn t want to take the bodies because they don t want to they don t have 6000 bodies of Russians
Shame to Zelesky and the West
"Notice how these are not conventional wars with ground troops, dog fights, hand to hand combat!?!? They take turns attacking each other! One side fires a bunch of missiles...then everything stops???? Half time!!! Now let s see what the other side is going to do! This is nothing more than getting rid of people... lowering the population count! It s all planned by the global leaders!"
"Well, since we all know that Ukraine and Russia pays of compensation for loved ones lost in this war, seems Ukraine is not in a rush to take those ones back to their relatives..."
"A sleeping lion should never be provoked, Mr. Zelensky is repeatedly provoking Iron Man Mr. Putin, which is causing the entire Ukrainian people to suffer."
It seems Russia is winning this war. I am glad our president Trump is backing away from Ukraine.
Chapter: Regarding Azl &lt&lt Sunan Abi Dawud 2172 &gt&gt 
They don t know the list because they just crab them from the street and sent them to the front line
Ukraine doesn t really care about their dead.
Nuclear products?
"No more wars please, for the sake of children and mental health all over the world. Peace and diplomacy. Please"
Hmmm … Russian response was mystifyingly mild …
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,,"
Russia has rights to defend himself
russia and Ukraine stop this nonsense
"US plans to use Ukraine fight indirect with superpower, and force EU to pay similar payments of US from your taxpayers So who loss - EU taxpayers and Ukrainian residents suffer because have been brainwashed to fight for US with Russia ‼️"
Irán 🇮🇷 is not just attacking isra even attack Ukraine
Lied based information that is that Russia only used 400 drones. How come Ukraine claimed that they shot down 450 drones ?
American doing all Zionist propaganda over Middle East
Seems like russian bots also got a boost after the drone strike
Russian army was powerful army why Ukraine attacked them and why hit Air bases??
Russia is self defening....
"&quotMoscow says strikes are a response to terrorist act of bombing civilian train&quot. No need for quotation mark around the word terrorist as my clarification defines it as a terrorist act. There, I fixed it for you Al Jazerra. For a news organization, your grammar sure is bad."
"GNN (Gaza News Network) also known as Al-Jazeera is not focusing on humanitarian issues in Ukraine. To them, humanity is defined as Palestinians."
If this is the so called retaliation then I m embarrass just like the other Russian war blogger as this is no difference from what they have been doing before. They should expect more from kiev.
"This war tends to ww3 , because Britain organizing ww3 to Demolish development of other countries, conquer Europe and Christianity and Zelensky be their Kingsman helpings them to achieve their goals. Peace needed EUROPEANS were compelled by British greed to start WW3😮"
Kyiv always stop all the missles.
Poor response from Russia after such a big Ukrainian attack
What goes around comes around
Terrorism will be punished
Russia is fighting not Ukraine alone but the whole Nato led by the US.
Russia is merciful unlike israel
Russia is terroeist
SHE IS LIVING LIKE NO WAR GOING ON LOL
BUT NAZI S LOVE DEATH
"NATO expansion threatening Russian National security is the root cause of the war. Folks who disagree should ask themselves, if US would allow a military alliance similar to NATO near US borders on the request of Cuba (remember Cuban missile crisis almost triggering WW3?) or Venezuela. NATO is not a country club you join to have a discount beer and a steak."
Ucronazis levando 
Oct 7bis really bad idea
"Spider Web joy short lived. Now, No where to hide when Hellfire rains down."
Zelensky where is your backers now.
Get the Zionist midget out and STOP the WAR!!!
Russia is the terrorist! They bomb homes after invading a sovereign country!
"The news really have depicted all Russian attacks as miscalculated and less effective. Now feel sorry for Ukrainians coz everything in the news shows theyre doing fine, have few casualities etc"
Choices have consequences.
Who’s fault the killing of innocent Ukrainian citizens NATO and Zelinsky
"So Ukraine is like Palestine, then Russia is like Israel. If not please let some hypocrite differentiate it."
Evil Putin is killing everyone in Ukraine 🇺🇦
"Russia isn t responding strong enough, how long will it take until Russia responds in a major way?"
russia has shown itself to be much like the nazis they claim to have defeated.
"Ukraine should understand one thing, have any of the nations &quothelped&quot by America prospered? Just see Pakistan, Afganistan, Syria, Iraq. They push insurgents to attack nations that they feel are a threat to them and also push insurgents into nations and sneak into them under the pretext of saving them from the insurgent which they themselves pushed in. The drama is elaborate. Once you start receiving the &quotHelp&quot of US, its over for you for ever."
Zalensky is terrorist and anti national kick him out
"These attacks take weeks to plan, so I doubt this was in retaliation to Ukraine s attack a few days ago."
"Foolishness, blood thirsty "
Shame on Putin
What is a good for!?
Russia is a losers absolute
I love how Youcrane hides Patriot systems within living districts 
Let them fight zelensky will know he s level in the end peace talks will be real and end the war
"Ukraine attacked military targets, while Russia attacked civilians (apartment buildings, hospitals eth) "
Pathetic Russia attacking civilians
While we see many direct hits i think still Zelenesky is lying kkkkkk.
Coming to America soon
We want peace in Ukraine but America don t want it
"Mean all this time you have been making noise, Russia has just started being serious"
"ONLY INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE IN ANY WAR. SO, STOP ALL WARS IN THE WORLD."
WE NEED NO MORE WARS! STOP THE WAR EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD!
Weak response
Rubble coming soon..
Stop this power ragging war. Exercising of might and power is evil. I dnt want to hear of any country military superiority. I just want people to live in peace.
Again the Russians attacks civilians like a bunch of weak cowards
What did Ukraine expect 
"So this is russia s great retaliation? to strike a bunch of buildings. Also how is striking military targets terrorism? if this is the case then that would mean any country striking any military target is also terorism, and this is not going to help their army on the ground which has not taken over more land since ukraine retook land north of kiev and karkhiv that russia initially took over."
This is why Russia is losing this war. The Ukrainians strike military targets that hurts the Russians bad! The Russians attack bunch of women and children sleeping in their beds!
Did they not expect retaliation?
Russian Federation 
To stop him now or to stop him later?That is the question!
Thanks aljazeera
"If this is all they could do as responses, Russia has nothing else under the sleeves"
Blame Zelensky..
So Ukraine hit bases and planes and bridges Russia hits civilians in Kiev Who is the real terrorist? Platypus looks unhinged
Zelensky must step down!! Stop the conflict and make peace
So Ukraine hit bases and planes and bridges Russia hits civilians in Kiev Who is the real terrorist? Platypus looks unhinged
Russia I m disappointed . Where is the radioactive mushroom cloud???
Zelensky nato puppet this man just had to say no to nato side wit Russia no war
Attention: Massive russofascists intrusion.
"If russofascists killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than zionazis killed Palestinian children, does that make russia four times less fascist than israel?"
"When Ukraine strike the west says awesome, when Russia respond they cry Oh its terrifying."
Zelensky the president of peace
Hahaha Everyone is criminal in this world Everyone is terrorist
I was expecting a huge strike on military assets or something. But not just this? This is pathetic
Only neutral status and federative status of Ukraine will satisfy Russia ( if Odessa and other mostly Russian speakers cities will be within Ukraine borders).
"Sungguh bodoh sekali rakyat ukraina kenapa tidak segera ganti presiden badut, zelensky itu sumber masalah untuk rakyat ukraina...bodoh sekali kalian."
"The joker should resign without putting the innocent people in danger. He has no idea what he is doing, too much ego creating disaster. Thank god that this was not nuclear or anything else yet."
Yes of course. &quotDebris&quot from the intercepted missiles. Definitely looks like a fallen missile or rock did that damage.
"&quotI haven t seen Hitler, but I see Nazis. I haven t witnessed the Holocaust, but I see people dying every moment. I m not afraid of animals, I m terrified of humans.&quot"
Vladimir Putin sir please reconsider your goal.. Many of your men including Ukraine men are dying for this war... Nobody wants war im an Asian please have a talk with a Democratic nation and settle this once and for all! It s the best decisive moment any nations can make. Please come into terms.... For the world to be a safer place to live.. From a construction worker from the Philippines 🙇‍♂️
Operation Tarantulas of Russia in retaliation against Operation Spider web of Ukr.
"Ukraine shoots down drones and missiles, violating the target. Missiles flying only at military targets. In this way, it kills its own citizens. Innocent people. Ukraine places air defense in residential areas, hiding behind peaceful citizens."
"One attack destroys an airbase, the other targets residential areas in a big capital and calls out a terror attack."
USA dan NATO harus bertanggung jawab atas semua kekacauan di seluruh penjuru dunia
People of Ukraine should dispose of Cocainensky in the first place
Dollar for dime
What that they expected
Zelensky danger to human civilization
That’s terrorist
"This is for every keyboard warrior! See the asymmetry where Russia bombs civilians and Ukraine plan war strategies! Before talking bullshit, which side you value?!"
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Not powerful enough.
"as an afghan i can sympathize with the civilian victims of the war between these two imperialist ,superpowers they also blown my country to pieces and an irresponsible leader like zelensky are usually the main cause of such catastrophies free Ukrain and free palestine"
"No matter what, the Russians still show humanity at a level we are not used to seeing even during war, The West and the US had no consideration at all for civilians even if they did nothing to them, in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, but the Russians have the ability to wipe out any city with one bomb but they don t do it."
Why are your only one country. Because of this fake propaganda.
And Russia destroyed how many aircraft? Z...Z...Zero!
what a weak strike
Zelensky escalating the war all by himself LMAO
All projectiles were intercepted by Spider web patriot defence shovel. Ukrainian Spokeperson
"Jewlensky wanted , Russia delivered "
"Still Ukraine targets military targets, while Russia targets civillian areas. Shame on Putin"
"Una guerra proxi de Ucrania que nunca se habría iniciado si la CIA yanqui y el MI6 británico no hubieran provocado el golpe de Estado del Euromaidan en Kiev en 2014. Además esas dos agencias anglosajonas financiaron y armaron a las organizaciones nazis ucranianas. De ahí a la guerra civil del Donbass y luego a la invasión rusa del 2022, hecha para proteger a las repúblicas del Donbass y sobre todo para la propia SEGURIDAD ESTRATÉGICA de la Federación Rusa. NO FUTURE WITH WARS. 🌎💰💰💰💀💀💀🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Ukraine attack Military site.... Russia attack Civilians area
"Chapter: The killing of Ka b bin Al-Ashraf Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: A critic of the prophet of Islam, Ka’b bin Al-Ashraf, had mocked him in verse. Muhammad asked his followers: “Who is willing to kill Ka’b bin Al-Ashraf who has hurt Allah and His Apostle?” One of the , Muhammad bin Maslama answered, “O Allah’s Apostle! Would you like that I kill him?” When Muhammad said that he would, Muhammad bin Maslama said, “Then allow me to say a (false) thing (i.e. to deceive Kab).” Muhammad responded: “You may say it.” &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 4037 "

"No more wars, please."
"This Russian special military operation has only exposed Russia s military weakness,Given NATO 2 new members, Encourage Europe to rearm,and made other nations less dependent on Russian Gas"
Our prayers are with you to stop. This wars
poor peaceful russia
Keep it up aljazeera journalists we all support you and the dignity of reporting
Our prayers Russia revenge not reaching Gaza situation oh God those two wars should stop in peace
"Putin is insane to make such comment, Ukraine is just defending itself and Russia under his leadership is the aggressor. How can Ukraine choose between peace and war?"
Putler taking like he wants peace not Ukraine 
"And again Putler creats excuses to keep up his war trough saying Ukraine is sabotage his country, what a weak KGB excuse 🫡"
"The attacks on bridges and railway lines in stolen Ukrainian Crimea are &quotacts of terrorism&quot while the targeting of schools, hospitals and residential blocks in Ukraine, rape and mutilation of civilians by Russian troops, are WHAT EXACTLY?"
This Zelensky guy will cry.
"The Ukrainian Joker Zelensky is not interested and serious on the ceasefire and he is not working for the Ukrainian state but as a pimp of British and CIA.The time of the attack when there was a possiblity of leadership level talks the idiot destroyed it by crossing the Russian Nuclear redline, Zelensky is the Ukrainian version the Israeli Motherfuc*er Netanyahu."
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 Stop the War ... Human rights organizations are dead ??
Russia is a joke
And Keiv still stands
A comedian belongs in the theatre im always astonished how a comedian is allowed to manage a whole nation..... is like mixing water with oil....  may Allah have mercy on Zelensky and it influences
"Putin have some nerves talking about peace, doe s he wants peace he only wants to grab more lands just like his predecessors in ancient Russia"
Ukraine targeting military targets not civilians like Russians they target civilians thats the difference
Ukraine targeting military targets not civilians like Russians they target civilians
You invaded a country and clamour for peace. What a foolish man Putin is
Zelenskyy attack Russia and suddenly rattles about peace
Even before this putin didnt accept any kind of ceasefire proposal
Who cares and does Africa benefit from old dictators who want to steal land
Putin seems angry. I wonder why.
Ukraine don’t want peace 
Russia are cooking something.... Be ware Ukraine
the next ceasefire and zelensky will start retaliate
"Ukraine will soon understand that the war is about to start, no ceasefire. Go motherRussia"
"Whatever NATO will do for ukraine is useless, madness, hypocrisy and delusional because they are blind and deaf on real atrocities and genocide in Gazza"
Go Russia go
if crybaby putin wanted peace he would tell his guys to pack up and go home. the more he fights the more weapons U.S and NATO give to ukraine

NATO shouldn t be worried about Ukraine because NATO is already blind deaf and dumb on GAZA ..SO WHAT IS HURRY when it comes about Ukraine ???
"If russofascists killed four times fewer Ukrainian children than judeozionazis killed Palestinian children, does that mean that russia is four times less fascist than israel?... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAVyVpVM5xc&ampt=11"">0:11</a>"
"Slava russia we all respect putins decisions for taking back what belonged to the soviet union back in history.....with love from nairobi,kenya"
"russia has the rights to defend it self, its russia turn"
Zelensky wants to prolong war to prolong his presidency. Power is addictive when you are being flattered by EU leaders and western elites.
The looser dictator
Zelesky is a puppet of Nato and Destroying own country for proxy war between Russia and Nato.
"More like, NATO doesn t want peace."
There was a time when the world feared Russia. Today the world laughs about Russia. What a pathetic country.
Infrastruckture meant to supply arms!
Mother Russia 
Al Jazeera is one of the best news channels in the world. It is worth watching and has made western propaganda news channels lagged behind
At present enemies of democracy USA United States &amp Ukraine political forces had Russia can easy access distroy by NATO nations such as someone moment is Very high dangerous crisis movement political forces by artificial fallows to this event. Russia can example political forces explain that s like the whole world democracy can ruling only one nation political command the soveat Union. 🚷☸️✝️🇺🇸🇮🇱⚔️🔥🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
Utter n*nsense….these news outlet as well the guests
"The Ukrainian Joker Zelensky is not interested and serious on the ceasefire and he is not working for the Ukrainian state but as a pimp of British and CIA.The time of the attack when there was a possiblity of leadership level talks the idiot destroyed it by crossing the Russian Nuclear redline, Zelensky is the Ukrainian version the Israeli Motherfuc*er Netanyahu."
They re trying to provoke the bear to do something foolish but the bear it s not a stupid bear it has no need to go nuclear it is already demonstrated it has alien technology because the hypersonic test without a nuclear payload was looking like an alien spaceship firing on Earth is enough to scare the bejesus out of anyone how easily they forget
Terrorist Ukraine .
&quotNow it s my turn&quot - Putin
NATO VS RUSSIA LETS NOT LIE
Putin is not serious
"Ukraine has no contingency plan for what is coming, people better leave cities like Kyev because this will be the worst retaliation since the beginning of this war where many victims including deaths will occur"
That was fast.
"Not Pearl Harbor, but more so the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. A daring long range attack that stunned the people of Japan."
That bridge was reopen 3 hours after the blast
Thanks aljazeera
"This is a statement from Ukraine, showing creativity in its attacks on Russias resources which are enabling Putin invasion of Ukraine. Even if we wish the damage was worse, this is showing Putin and its citizens that Russia IS at war and they won’t go untouched. The only difference is, Ukraine attacks military targets, Russia attacks innocent citizens. Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦"
"YouTube, EZEKIEL 38 wars. Countries destroyed for opposing the Palestine occupation Somalia Sudan Libya Yemen Afghanistan Iraq Syria Lebanon Palestine Russia Rohingya Uighur Kashmir Kosovan Iran. War killed millions of innocent people and caused millions of jobless and homeless in America and Europe."
No damage but proved a point. Russia is not out of touch.
"“Ukraine wants a ceasefire” by attacking the planes, standing in the open according to the nuclear treaty with the USA, their ally and supplier? Are you a pro-Ukrainian media outlet? Don’t you know the consequences of breaking nuclear treaties for the world? Are you advocating nuclear WWIII?"
That bridge could collapse at any time.
Russia says NOTHING. NOTHING BUT BULLSHIT
Bullshit! Russian propoganda. Slava Ukraine!
"Stop narrating Ukraine versus Russia, it is NATO versus Russia"
Congratulations to the Ukrainians.
Alah died in an airstrike in khan younis last evening
Cremeria is Ukraine custody
"So what do Russians call it attacks on Ukraine, love taps. What wrong with these people."
So basically that was all for nothing
The engineers who built this bridge should build my next relationship.
in russia bridge need no pillar
"Wait, I though this bridge was the best guarded and protected piece of infrastructure in the world. Not even a fly would be able to come close to it. What happened, Kremlin? Where are your ultra-competent intelligence services? 😪"
"That was only western propaganda media, reality hit miner one"
" Then he said, Where is the little one? Call the little one to me. Hasan came running and jumped into his lap. Then he put his hand in his beard. Then the Prophet opened his mouth and put his mouth in his mouth. &quot &lt&lt Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 1183 "
Why is Al Jazeera running a 2-year+ old footage of the truck bombing attack on this bridge?
"Allah s Messenger said, &quotIf anyone of you goes to an open space for answering the call of nature he should neither face nor turn his back towards the Qibla he should either face the east or the west.&quot &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 144 "

" Allah s Messenger said, &quotWhile I was at Makkah, the roof of my house was opened and Jibril descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zamzam water. &lt&lt Sahih al-Bukhari 3342 "
Who dares crossing this bridge?
Zelensky will never Learn
Crimea belongs to ukraine russia is illegally occupying crimea...and its illegal invasion of ukraine illegal under international laws and u.n charter..russia must be kick out of u n for its action on crimea ukraine..
Why not Ceasefire for Palestine 🇵🇸 ???
Russia 🇷🇺 🪆and Ukraine 🇺🇦 direct talks in Turkey 🇹🇷
Russia should swallow its pride there s no way Ukraine should withdraw from areas they have never captured instead they should withdraw from Ukrainian territories they have failed to complete capture
Russia doesn t negotiate with terrorists. The status quo remains the same.
"Can you imagine, satanic demands. How can you dictate, the numbers of people enlisted in a sovereign nation Army. This is ridiculous. Is like Kremlin officials reason with their foot and not brains. They must pull out troup from where you are not able to capture militarily. Am laughing in my language"
"O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger &lt&lt Quran 4:59 "
Russia is being too nice. If it was the us army Ukraine would have been a waste land already
"Russia s demands are ridiculous, Jesus."
Russia: &quotTrust me bro.&quot Ukraine: &quotNo.&quot
Justice for Sana Yousuf ?
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,,,,"
"No ukrainian, NATO involve attack on bridge"
Putin playing with this FOOL for far too long now he started to look weak..what is he doing ??? He s LETTING this fool playing him like fool...
Now i am beginning to doubt about Russia capability
If you overdo it then you are not aiming for peace but war
Zelensky s aim should be peace and not war
"Ukraine just wants to lose more land above this area, so russia doesn t just have one access bridge"
How is russia a super power?
More and more leaders are crazy and eager for violence and war. Idiots who don t know how precious life is and that they throw this gift away. Every nation has the leaders they deserve. Enjoy the idiots you elect.
"No idea what zelensky is trying to prove that he is idiot. Well, we all know that. Russia will take out all ukrainian infrastructure. Parasite zelensky does not care about own people."
Cars have started going over bridge .
The Ukrainians people are held hostage by their non Ukrainians leaders. A third of Ukraine has fled to Russia. 3 million in Poland. Milions in surrounding countries. Ukraine only has 25% of thier population left. They are hostages to a terrorist regime like the people in Gaza.
These deep sea divers obviously got an agenda
Putin would have accepted Ukraine to be neutral. He told the West for years no to NATO for Ukraine. Put the same scenario to the US and potentially hostile states surrounding that nation. The US wouldnt accept it.
Ukraine is boxing above its weight with encouragement from some countries.
Poke the Bear and find out.
"Russia doesn’t use the Crimea bridge for military or civilian supplies since the last bridge bombing attack by Ukraine. All the military supplies are now shipped via the occupied land by train. So, the bridge attack doesn’t have any military significance - only political."
"More bad news for AJ. They can’t catch a break between Russia, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza "
What is putin waiting for. Putin is coward now
"It’s all over for Ukraine, Russia has been going on lightly on civilians and infrastructure unlike Israel."
Utube is just another establishment backing MSM platform
I never thought a few years back that aljazeera would turn into propagandist channel.
NATO really going for it !!!
Russia has more nukes than US. They are ranked num 1. Ukraine be playing with fire I think they don t know
INDIAN AND RUSSIAN BOTS ARE THE SAME AS TERROIRST GROUPS
Ukraine is a terrorist state
"Zelensky is the destroyer of Ukraine, after 3 years what has he gained, lost 20% of land, thousands of people died, the country is devastated......."
"London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down, falling down. My fair lady !"
Russia have you see u are playing a hide and seek game with Ukraine now have you seen the damage NATO have cost u
Putin never forget and forgive his enemies  now wait and see the Retaliation
"I m beginning to suspect that the Super Freinds under Aquaman supervision is responsible for this!? And I m certain the  Wonder Twins,and a primate were involved.."
"russia is just pathetic, it cannot even defend itself from anything anymore"
Zelensky has suicidal thoughts after this.
Useless Aljazeera…. It’s called a terrorist attack….
You can say for sure Armageddon about to begin in a matter of days .
"I’ve always stood up for the truth and justice and in this war it’s Putin the one who is in the right. But BUT after seeing for years that he doesn’t do F all in retaliation except eating cabbage, I’m now fed up and congratulate Zelensky and the CIA for the provocative attacks."
Why is everyone cheering? This is not mean peace. This means more war
Russia engineers are amazing. The bridge withstand that impact should be studied
Zelensky is intimidating he want to make cous this man is danger or he is control by NATO
Human rights organisation nonsense must stay out of what s coming
From Comedian to Strategist this is M Zelenskyy
"Russian bridge 3, Ukraine 0"
But Tonald Drump promised there would be peace within 24 hours before he would become president he would solve Russia and Ukraine war what happened Drumpf?
Turns out he had the cards while the one who said he did not have them is not playing with a full deck.
The Ukrainians want to prove with these US actions that the war is not lost yet and give us weapons and money and we will still win! I wonder how much longer the West will throw money down the drain!
"Not a thousand explosives, over a thousand kilograms of explosives."
Ukraine 🇺🇦 should wait for response and its not Ukraine 🇺🇦 BUT WEST....
"RUSSIA CAN TRANSPORT GOODS BY LAND, SO WHAT S THE SENSE OF DESTROYING THE BRIDGE IF THE GOODS WILL BE DELIVERED ANYWAY?"
Kiev and Amarica are really trying to get Putin to respond with oreshnic missiles. Then they can say look at Russia escalating. Lol
well lasors are the way to go for istance to launch a missle costs thousands to fire a lasor costs a few dollars its obvious. also ukraine can knock out nucliar missles with them.
Why not show after the explosion? no damage done?
Ukraine is winning 
"At this point we can all agree that Russia is a joke. Surviving only on propaganda, solely relying on its nukes, scaring and bullying people with atomic devastation. No other nuclear capable country even mention an attack with nuclear weapons."
They re trying to distract Russian troops because they re close but they soon feel the wrath of the
Really Putin is going to use nuclear weapons ? Very very bad news. We have no dare to see more innocent people dying after watching gaza
"The Russian paper tiger is a joke, they are destined to fail!"
They do stupid things but they didn t know what will happen next.
"Putin is playing with Ukraine. As I said before, he is playing with Zelensky and Zelensky may be the one to kill him."
This is bad news. War will expend
Putin should stop massaging Zelensky
"Let them enjoy their short term victory. But please, dnt start talk crying victim when they are hit hard. Because there is no need for this level of recklessness that cant lead to peace"
Confused whether watching Aljazira or BBC !
Ukraine is digging his own grave 
Russia does not use that bridge for arms supply anymore. It s purely civilian use now. They supply via land now... look at a map.
What is with these pro Russian comments?
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦🇵🇭
"Clearly, Zelensky doesn t want this war to end, otherwise why will he keep provoking Putin while talks are ongoing."
NATO playing with fire. You will crying foul soon. Russians are good in this game!
Poor Ukraine people will suffer for this.... So sad
"Al jazeera, have you ever seen Russian reporters being happy about killings in Gaza?"
A civilian bridge.The Army do not use it. Typical Al Jazeera nonsense. They still can t get over the fact that Russia played a vital role in Syria.
"It s not Ukraine, these actions are being done by US, UK, France and Germany. It is to derail the capture of most of the Ukraine."
If this is true these guys are extremely extremely impressive. That bridge would have been closely monitored.
In Sha Allah Russia 🇷🇺 Will Be Victorious
Putains strategic patience seems more like hoping that he will be hanging out with the western partners he secretly would like to buddy up with
America and European countries have strengthened Ukraine to attack Russia 🇷🇺 because they all think that Russia is a big threat to their country
"Wasn t that bridge NO LONGER used by the Russian military to serve military logistics? They ve already moved to land-based roads and railways, and the bridge now only serves civilian traffic."
The wait for the response
"Trump asked him if he had a card, and he did drone suicide."
Russia hyperfans from indonesia: 
"This is not Ukraine, but Europe and the US, who are fighting with Russia. But Russia is very soon reciprocating to this attack."
Mad men should not have long-range airframes anyways!
"Nato forces out of mind, they pressing WWAR"
Saying patriot can shoot down Oreshnik is like saying Biden can run up the stairs without stumbling.
Bullies only understand strength. Operation Web!
"This all basically, good luck Peace in Turkey. Many sides clearly not interested in peace now."
Russia being very patient
"When you ve lost the conflict and there s nothing more to do, you resort to terrorism. Whatever your propaganda, Zelensky will finally sign the capitulation deal. The Russians only focus on the final outcome."
Ukraine is on suicide mission .
"Russia is not Middle East Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya, war with Russia big mistake."
"Crazy, ukraine has forces deep deep inside russia."
i fail to understand why peace talk in going on in instanbul yet ukraine is busy bombarding russia
"Aljazeera talked like Ukraine mouth,aljazeera Nato fake news,shame on u Qatar 🇶🇦"
Again and again and again provocation continues..... Don t believe a ju.....zelenskey is a ju
Attention: massive intrusion by russofascists.
with this Pace Ukraine will take over Russia soon. what a turn around
Ukraine is playing with fire.
"That s ok, if at first you don t succeed..."

Rumour has it that Putin is hiding just like Allah after the pager attack
"President Trump is correct. Unnecessary War It s not about Russia invading. It is about AZOV ethnically cleansing Ukrainians for speaking a different dialect of their common Russian language. Unnecessary War Merkel worked out a solution for peace, but Johnson and Biden bribed the little man to continue to push for war. I hope Putin have the courage to avail himself of the opportunity for peace offered by the President. This is an unnecessary War. May God never forgive those that pushed the world to the brink of a nuclear war. Namely: Johnson and Sunak, Scholtz, Biden, Starmer, Merz, Blinken and Macron."
"Damage- driving cars over a damaged bridge is not the same as a train, which this bridge does have"
Do they not know that Russia can wipe out nearly every bridge in Ukraine in a 24 hour period or less.. Targeting bridges with civilian traffic is terrorism.
Russia has whole Land bridge to supply it s forces
"Ukraine can’t win this war without the U.S., and Russia’s response will be violent."
"Not &quot more than 1000 explosives&quot, 1100kg of explosives"
Zelensky..has a death wish
"Know Islam, No peace  No Islam, know peace"
"Now USA and the world knows that Ukraine has ” more Cards” than they thought. Keep defending yourself, Viva Ukraine 🇺🇦 "
I think Ukraine doesn t want to live anymore
Zelensky poured cold water on any swapping of dead personnel.
Shame on America
Ukraine is western backed why is Russia still holding back this much... They could have destroyed Ukraine if it was the west eg usa they would use nukes by now.. Am sure..
"6000 to 6000 dead solders, how can that be, Ukraine 🇺🇦 doesn t have that many Russian dead soldiers, Russia is going to get hundreds dead while Ukraine is going to get 6000 dead soldiers"
So many young men dying for politicians.
Thanks aljazeera
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE THE SOLDIERS OF ISRAEL TAKE A VACATION IN YOUR COUNTRY... DO YOU ACCEPT THEM... THEY KILLED HUNDRED OF CHILDREN AND ROB THEIR LAND
Never trust russofascists and judeozionazis.
6000 dead  imagine how many people died for what! They gave them lives for Some fools
"But someone has to make Russia get serious on peace, this movement of back and forth exchange of prisoners is not a success bse they ve always exchanged prisoners there s nothing like success in this negotiations Turkey should stop confusing us"
Turkish ardogan and the whole country is not a fit and just place to do any peace making agreement...
Who are those Russian military specialists? Maybe its time to publish their names!
6000 to 6000 so that is 12000 lives wasted just in that comment. So sad
I was surprised that Ukraine was able to launch such a high quality operation.
Brilliantly done by Ukraine.
Russia should cut their losses and just end the war.
"The message to Russia &amp the US is you re vulnerable. Planes, infrastructure, politicians, &amp more are sitting ducks"
Oreshniks inbound
No Sanction on EU/ US allies Israel .. Witnessing Genocide in real time..
I liked the articulation of India’s stance. Thank you.
Those planes are like 70 years old ... lol the youngest of them maybe 30 ... I don t think it s a big deal .. they would not have used those planes for nuclear strikes ...
Zelensky and Ukrainians love war and Sanctions. Let them continue to enjoy fighting Russia. USA must focus on growing their economy.
God bless Ukraine 🇺🇦
Masha la. Ukraine is best. Bismi la
Putin is so bitter since he likes destroying lives and properties other countries and not his. A time will come and is here when Russia will accept and say to people there is a living God in heaven and he oversee everything on earth
No country can be arrogant enough on this earth like Russia killing people and their properties as if they are the creators of the earth and thereof. One time not far Russia will come to understanding that God is supreme
Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Zeleniski will DESTROY Ukraine. He does not care about the country. Just his position which will be terrible once the war actually Stops. Is there a coincidence such an attack came days before the ceasefire talks? Only fools get played and majority of the masses are fools. This comment section a prime example how people are easy to be played with.
I wonder if the US has helped Ukraine.
Forget China. Russia is well on track to becoming North Korea s junior partner 
Russia should not accept any peace negotiation going forward.
Putin is delusional. Why would Ukraine agree to surrender when he is losing?
I like it when western media fools everyone by promoting the narrative they have been paid for.
Yang wenli like tactic
Russia occupy less area after three years of war than in the beginning of the invasion. They lack the capability to defeat Ukraine. There is no &quotescalation&quot from russia. They have been doing their worst for 3 years.
Russia will soon realize that being a superpower isn t by invading a small Ukraine. Ukraine is gradually making Russia weak before Europe. Germany has to find its purpose and make Europe safe.
"With this singular attack by Ukraine, Putin should negotiate. And do it now. He does not know what the clown/jester (Zelensky) has planned for him ."
I can not imagine how angry Putin is right now.
And the world turned upside down- Hamilton the battle of Yorktown
It s impossible for the USA not to know that was going to happen. What were Two Doll Donnie s threats to Russia about?
"Trumps! sanction/tariff did not work against Russia,, only bombs work... it is war not economy?"
The lobbied paid war monger countries and its paid battlefield states versus independent sovereign countries. Let s see.
It s like something right out of Ace Combat. May Ukraine prevail!
"Ukraine has cards, everyone aare dealt cards. Going all-in with pocket deuces and hoping nobody calls is a gamble. Now they have to wait and see what response they get. It s the waiting that really tortures. 9/11 and Oct 7 attacks didn t benefit the attackers in the longer run."
Not a religious person but David and Goliath is a great metaphor here is a great metaphor. Russia has always been a lumbering oaf.
Was it confirmed that the drones were AI-trained? I’ve heard conflicting reports.
The blatant violation of the START Treaty with the terrorist attacks on Russian strategic nuclear bomber bases? The &quotmessage&quot is that the US is a UK colony and should no longer be negotiated with.
Zelensky and Netenyahu are two Jews from eastern Europe are bringing about the end of humanity as we currently know it.
Zelensky is trying to start world war three.
Not good for peace talk for the war
Moral of the story never trust in USA.
"This one caught everyone by surprise. ""Spider's Web"" may not change the course of the war, but it leaves Putin and his ally Trump with some questions: if the Ukrainians did it once, can they do it again? And on what scale?"
"Russia s red lines mean nothing. Oh no, nuclear saber rattling again..."
"First at the start. Why would anyone care what America thinks, it is at best neutral and more like a bad actor in the Ukraine war now. Guess we have to keep the Yanks from whining or they will withdrawal all support."
Lady why r u shuting
The only message is that they want another Oreshnik.
"As much as the attacks where brilliant, i am so afraid of the reciprocal reactions."
India supports Russias war machine
",,,4000km!! Russia shoujd be afraid, it doesnt matter even if it was launched from inside Russia what is evident is it has NO capability to monitor the vast Russian terittory, So are the Yankies as was demononstrated by “ chinese weather ballon”"
What message? Desperation?
"Zelenzky have criminal Jewish back up,"
"Because of this war European is hard may people are at home,  Loss their jobs energy and food costs a lot in European. We need peace"
They did good job that didn t consult with trump.He could have stopped or leaked information.
"Arrest Zelensky and bring him back to reality, stop clowning around"
So many rounds of sanctions on Russia but none on Israel no wonder Russia is dismissive of the double standards West.
Zelenzky has the cards.
"Western World only consists about 15~20 % of world population, and the pure White Skins are about t become minority of their own native countries. Yet, they love to killed themselves at wars, amid the low birth rate. Besides the war, they are addicted to alcohols, drugs, gun violence, married out of their race and LBGTQ. In next 20 years, Pure Whites will be less than 10~15% of world population. Looking forward to Indian decented PM and Presidents of all English Speaking countries, and UK already had one as an example."
"How many times Zelensky celebrated, and then cry after "
If this was planned for over a year then there is no turning back. Past year of talks has been a lie. These white nations have not been civilized so consequently they still acting up and testing weapons on each other as they continue to destroy OLD WORLD ARCHITECTURE
Psy Op….they are the same people. No one is naive to believe there isn’t a bigger play.
What a PR STUNT BY KYIV REGIME...as always..this won t change the course of the smo..Moscow will achieve all its objectives..this regime never learns at all
"☪ Chapter: The Rights Of A Woman Upon Her Husband It was reported from Hakim bin Muawiyah that he asked: &quotO Messenger of Allah! What are the rights that our wives have over us? He replied: &quotThat you feed her when you eat, and clothe her when you wear clothes, and that you avoid hitting her in the face 👊 &lt&lt Sunan Abu Dawud 2142 &gt&gt 💪"
Summer is prime war fighting season
"Ukraine destroyed 50% of Russian Blacks Sea fleet, without having any fleet on their own. 30% of strategic air force without having strategic air force on their own. They are not clowns they’re magicians!"
The Jew just loves shedding more Christian blood
That litle guy messed up
Zelensky wants to get rid of more Ukrainians by doing this .
Lots of Americans believe Russian propaganda
The clown wants unconditional ceasefire without Russian retaliation? Very smart clown.
What happened after pearl harbor? That s what s going to happen to Ukraine now.
Goncharenko is a total GRIFTER
"These guy is an absolute clown . This war is three years plus old and sanctions only made Russia retool it s economy, some new sanctions will not do anything."
"Russia already has 16k different sanctions and it hasn t slowed, much less stopped. Sanctions only sound good in the public s ear."
Better question is how do we stop US and Britain with E.U. Following right along…….
You have no points to upload
Ukraine is winning and still Ukraine losing land and manpower
"America has lost interest , the focus has moved on ."
Best News! Really appreciate the Russians inspite of drone attack!!
Why do we only hear the Ukrainian side of the story and not the Russian side?
Exchange Putin for all Russian prisoners
I don t know how Russia can agree to a ceasefire since the rare earth deal between Ukraine and the U.S.
"attacking Russia during peace talk and they say they want to end the war, that s never going to happen even a kid can see that"
The word deported is misused in context.
Seems Putin has been hurt by yesterdays strikes... Their power comes from the perception of their power... Power is reduced now
Please live up to promise in ASAP including the the hand over of Iraq and Syria unconditionally. What do you think is political settlement become promulgated peacefully any time in the future!!
It is time for the European Colonialist Zio’s (ECZ) also to stop occupation of Palestine.
"respect Russia, no war crimes, unlike Israel"
When will the European Colonialist Zio’s stop the Palestine genocide?
Zelensky spreads propaganda as he speaks.
That’s why I don’t trust Putin &amp Trump.
Russia should direct deal with countries supplying weapons and money… making Ukraine as proxy …..
This war would ve been over from 3 years ago if Boris the clown didnt stop Zelensky.
Attacks were made by the NATO not the Ukraine. It is the first sign that NATO fully attacking Russia under the flag of Ukraine!!
Ukraine must not provoke a NUCLEAR ATTACK on its territory!!!! Russia has a right to self defense against any EXISTENTIAL THREATS
"A Brief Look at Operation “Ukrainian Spider Web” : Analysis by Dr. Vladimir Brovkin Zelensky Attacks Russian Air Base: A Gamble to Lose to Ukraine? The number of damaged aircraft is around 10 to 13, some of them badly damaged beyond repair, but these are very very old Soviet bombers, even Tu22 (not to be confused with Tu22M which is a newer and much better model), which have not been used since 1980 (probably used for training). I can only say for Irkutsk Region because the base is nearby. It is an old Soviet base that lost its strategic significance in the mid-1980s and most of its strategic fleet has been moved to Bratsk. The aircraft in Belaya or Srednii as it is known today are quite old and of limited value, they also did not participate in Ukraine. To top it all off, a group of truck drivers prevented most of the attacks, they climbed onto trucks and smashed many drones with rocks. They will be awarded medals for bravery for this action. For whatever reason, the attack was carried out in a hurry because the drone truck simply stopped at a truck stop near the federal highway with an airbase in sight... but the truck stop was full of other trucks and people. Hopefully this explains a little about the situation in Irkutsk Oblast, everything can be verified by checking local newspapers and channels. As usual, Ukrainian and Western propaganda unreasonably exaggerates the number of destroyed aircraft and even mentions the damage at $7 billion. This is simply impossible because the entire program of modernizing the Tu160 (the fastest and largest bomber in the world) to the supermodern M2 variant costs $2.6 billion or about $100 million per new aircraft, including research and development. And thank you, Professor Brovkin, for your always excellent contribution. OFFICIAL SOURCE: source from : @SiberianTeddy"
Wait until Vladimir pulled out Russian artificial intelligence drones. Ukraine is not fighting their own battles they re being helped by other the strategy to pull off such an attack did not come from them
"God bless Russian, Glory to Russian in Jesus Mighty Name Amen, Salam Alaikum, wa Alaikum Salaam,,,"
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto,Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,,,"
Terrorists worldwide now have a new tactic in their arsenal of mayhem.
Crazy attack tho
Fake news !!! People this fake war !!! Wake up
Isreal started this Ai drone thing
Zelensky is still playing with fire again
This attack behind the America
Alex Karp of Palentir claims to set p targets for Ukraine military
Ukraine acting just like israel and all are including european countries with jews are only intentions for misguided to Russia into war ukrain have never planned to win over russia but America wants to Russia bow down slowly slowly into war because all way for America and jews cleared for one world orders where they do anything by way of devil s path
Hidden in trucks ???? Crossing the border ??? From Ukraine to Russia ??? It seems there is no traffic so how is it possible ?
Ukrainians are Jews and Zionist . President Putin is a world leader 
"Putin or his field generals are insane, leaving all the planes in the same place. They should have been spread out across different locations. The very stupid comedian was simply ordered by his bosses, Trump, the European Parliament, and NATO to carry out this attack. He must respond with worse currency or with atomic bombs. I'm waiting, Great Comrade Putin."
Did poopstain say thank you for the gifts from ukraine?
Russia followed the New Start treaty that agrees that all strategic bombers have to be in plain sight at all times. Both Russia and the USA must protect the security of the other countries strategic bombers in these locations under this treaty! The USA broke the treaty when they allowed Ukraine to attack these planes. Not a win for Ukraine it is a huge loss for the USA as now no one can ever trust the USA in any agreements they make. Russia was stupid to ever trust the USA on any thing ask the Native Americans about American treaties!
Zelensky is asking for atomic bomb?
"This commentator, in my opinion: is alternatively gifted with false narratives, you will ask the question: why? I will answer you: the Russian Federation is a conglomerate of indigenous peoples enslaved by the Kremlin terrorist group, for a very long time. And on this scientific approach, the social aggregator for the decolonization of this terrorist entity is the entire enslaved population of these lands, even those who call themselves Russians."
"It s hilarious how these fools always report what Ukraine says as fact and won t disclose casualties, but are quick to do so with Russia and even interview the &quotvictims&quot."
Of course western media doesn t cover this real news. Thank you
Russia is a relic from the past...
This was dumb.. Those planes are bombers.. Nukes. They must be visible. Even the USA knows this.. Well Ukraine ur done now..
No doubts that they never told the Americans what they were doing. Just can t trust the US anymore. The US would have ratted Ukraine out to their Ally Russia with a smile.
"Magnificent. Absolutely beautiful. Go home russia, you re drunk again."
It s impossible to attack Russia without the help of US...
"AS I PRAY TO HOME FROM WAR- 2025? Darling, I miss you more than words can tell As the torments of war burden my heart. I worry about you and how you are As by conflict we’re forced to part. As death confronts me, I witness first hand Just how sudden life can come to its end. At any moment war can consume and destroy Myself, my dreams, my enemy, my friend. Determined though fearful I dream of home Remaining focused, steadfast and whole. Praying for family, country and comrades The treasures of my existence and soul. I suffer pain, remorse and regret From actions I’m forced to employ. I have no choice but to do my duty As my solemn oath becomes my story. Remind our kids how much I love them And those moments they cry or play. I pray to be home for hugs and kisses Hopefully by night and Day. Most of all I pray for words That portray my need for your touch. I dream of you both night and day And sometimes a bit too much. Letters from home, loneliness, and sorrow Have made family more precious to recall. I love you so incredibly much As I serve with honor, and country’s call. By Tom Zart"
what happened to russian oreshnik. was it just hype:)
"Russia, China, Pakistan and North Korea military V Israel, India, USA, UK and France Military "
The claims of Ukraine and what they hit and destroyed are greatly exaggerated by western media and propagandists
Now Russia will respond very badly
"Now what will happen to Ukraine, the backlash from Moscow. Have to wait and see. God bless Ukraine."
The question is whether Vladimir Putin will consider this attack as an attack by the West because Ukraine cannot do this alone
War is no easy show. There is no walk over. How is such a country not even regarded as a super power doing so much damage to Russia? Is Russia honestly as powerful as they claim to be?
"in Germany , Who has Hamburg ? Who says (We have Hamburg)? Olaf Scholz-Dead (Beamter&ampBezirk) Jens Spahn&ampSusanne Daubner"
Erdogan and the Turkish government are obviously dictators and despots who have supported terrorism however they are very diplomatic and geopolitically useful
"Turkey in the English language is Turkey . This modern obsession with correct pronunciation is idiotic for two reasons: (1) No non-Turkish speaker will ever pronounce Türkiye perfectly without extensive training, and (2): It should be perfectly legitimate to use a different name anyway thereby each country s language is equally respected. After all, München in English is Munich ..."
Peace for peoples happiness god bless for world
"FM, you did good job, but wasted as Zeky ruined it for more heavy destruction from Russia. So he has more chance to beg West and EU for condem and dragging him in NATO."
"Russia in Istanbul to talk about PEACE with people who only want to continue the PROXYWAR in Ukraine, WHAT A JOKE"
"This war must end, it is Vietnam all over. Neither side can achieve total victory. Stop the death"
Turkey is a joker who can t allow refuge of Palestine they still suffering and they not allow them in their country instead they are focus on Ukraine Russia issue
Good efforts by Turkiye
Well done Turkiye 
"its not realistic to expect a final comprehensive peace deal from this in my view, but every incrimental issue affected by the war like grain shipments, prisoner exchanges or other humanitarian reconciliation efforts are a win for both russians and ukrainians"
"India s Papa ( Russia) is beginning for peace, guess from whom, Turkey love from Pakistan"
"So, Al Jazeera says that the Russian troops on the border are changing the mood of the negotiations. But failed to answer the question Have the attacks on Russia last night changed the mood? Instead Dimitri rambled on about another topic when asked."
"Telling Netanyahu or Putin: stop making war is like telling an architect: stop designing or telling a chef: stop cooking. They have this profession, war full of crimes, just like projects without calculations or expired food. The whole world is shocked by these two."
We are praying for peace and healing of both countries no more wars let forgiveness lead
Much more important: Why Türkiye don’t talk about freedom in Palestine Free Palestine
Türkiye has been doing a lot of winning lately. I believe they can help settle this. More than USA
Free Free Free Kurdistan

If Ukraine want peace they should first remove comedian zelensky he is a puppet of Europe
"Is it just me, or does “sustainable peace” sound like “level of NATO aggression Russia can tolerate”?"
"Shame on Turky, the genocide is going on in Palestine but no country trys to stop the genocide in Gaza commiting by Israel, what a double standard and selfishness"
John Hendren thanks for your excellent reportage
No ceasefire zelensky is traitor
Almost obscene for majority of men to be on front lines dying while in Kyiv citizens promenade on a bridge in Spring time.
🇷🇺 I m Russian
"It doesn t even seem like there is a war in Ukraine. Compare it with Gaza, which has been totally destroyed."
I pray for peace 
JeoUwTube stop deleting comments
"Respect UK 🇬🇧 and Europe 🇪🇺 , 🇺🇦 Ukraine Blame on Russia, 🇺🇸 USA I Hate Russia and I Support Ukraine From Ohio"
Join and go to die makes no sense
how many trillions of dollars have been taken from Russians in Western banks and holdings? How can there be a peace treaty without this been repaid?
My view is that the actions of 2014 were un called for. The government was overthrown back by Western nations.
It s ignorant to depend on other countries to pay for your wars.
I scrolled thru like 100 posts on iran until finally coming to just one old story on Ukraine. Are you journalists?
Plenty of closer targets in the largest nation of the world. Clearly ukraine wish to extend this conflit to a wider area. Suit youyrself
Slava Ukrain.
Who cares America stay out of it we have more pressing issues Iran. You don t want the USMC coming for you keep that in mind.
IM SUING HAN NGA KASKADA
Trump and Putin may respond to this special military operation together
its wars of west against eastern nation no credit to ukrainian they have sold their soul to suttun and devil long ago.
"how in the world 2 nation that speak same language and almost have same culture fight a war which the people and the nation whom cause it do not share any of their values ,its missed up."
Russia vs allied forces 1 vs all
Russia will strike back at Ukraine... This conclusion follows from a message from Donald Trump after his conversation with our president. And apparently it will be either tonight or a little later.
Thank you Aljazeera for your pursuit of truth in journalism 
Us has diamond and golds lets steal
Israel is a terrorist and illegal occupation fascist state
"I pray that Russia doesn’t retaliate this won’t go down well, this zalenski is trying to sink Ukraine. This should not be celebrated."
We all know RUSSIA LAUNDERING MAFIAS MONEY thru Quatar
I think free russian legion fighters involved at the attack
"Ukraine is getting flattened after this, watch people cry about it in a few days"
Who knows how many shipping containers still lying dormant inside Russia waiting...
Russia has a right to self defense THIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO RUSSIA 🇷🇺 UKRAINE MUST NOT PROVOKE A NUCLEAR WAR ON ITS TERRITORY
So called advanced and cultured people are going to devastating the world again...
I just wonder how long Trump will order flags to be flown at half mast. This must be devastating to both him and his MAGA buddies.
Without internal help and hand this is near impossible. Looks like Ice is Breaking for Putin .
"Wars and rumors of wars, book of Revelation"
"idk why everyones celebrating, what do u think will happen to ukraine now, now russia has more reason to do more horrible things, governments are scum, and nationalists are scum too, u know majority of the people in the world just wana live in peace and be left alone"
It means Ukraine doesn’t want peace Ukraine want to continue war otherwise this wasn’t the time to take this action while they talking about peace in Turkey
"Finally, Trump continues Biden s policy of stealing former Russian territories because of their wealth and approaching the US military strategic arsenal."
This is Nato Vs Russia war
Dont underestimate Ukraine we have the cards
What if an unknown sailing yacht sinks a US aircraft carrier.Did you think what was going on
"A historical event that will be in the war books, Ukraine still has the Trump cards."
"Putin is so weak and terrified, he’s hushing this attack. Almost no information on it in Russian media."
"As per the New START treaty with the United States, Russia has to keep their strategic bombers in the open so their numbers can be monitored. The US does the same. After this, I don t think Russia will be trusting US treaties anymore."
Some Russian generals must be feeling real nervous right now
Ukraine is just looking for trouble
See Like Russia USA CHINA UK EU have weak spots. India and Israel are aware.
Was it drones or was it the death ray that was used on Malibu????
"Putin attacks civilian targets. Ukraine military targets. Putin s invasion of Ukraine was cowardly act driven by fear, greed and delusion. It s cheaper for Europe to support Ukraine now than if Putin ever succeeds in Ukraine, where he has already made clear he won t stop. Putin is responsible for the deaths of nearly 1 million Russians and hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. The Russians mostly men from outside Moscow, from the East of Russia, brought into the army. The Ukrainians suffering losses of soliders but also children, women, elderly, disabled through Putin s targeting of civilian centres."
"Perang ini tidak akan pernah berakhir, dulu, Amerika melawan Vietnam membutuhkan waktu hampir 30 tahun dan hasilnya tidak sesuai harapan, dan masih banyak lagi perang yang tiada akhir"
"This must be genious, how on earth have they driven a truck with missiles all the way through Siberia? Are there even paved roads all the way to Kamchatka?"
UK tax money burning on this pointless war
Key features of the operation: 1.Smuggled weapons inside Russia in multiple locations. 2. Stay undetected for more than a year. 3. Coordinate with agents inside Russia beside the intelligence agency of Russia 4. Launch them drones inside Russia. 5. Destroyed billions of military assets for just a 100 plus drones.
Zelenski is a foolish man Zelenski crying started
Wish Palestine has this capability to defend themselves
US support russia attack?
"Why are you not talking about how the Ukrainians with US intel violated the NEW START Agreement? Those planes were out in the open specifically so that US satellites can see them. Trump broke the Treaty and you are shilling for the Trump administration. No its not props for the Ukrainians, these planes were sitting ducks because NEW START gives Russia guarantees of protection from the United States. Shame on you, shame on Trump."
They did the damages but now what their attack will be more furious.
Putin will respond at the appropriated time ....
well lets hope things dont go nuclear now
Russian retaliation is going to be insane !!!
"God have mercy on us All, God help us All, Amen"
"You kmow what W 1,2 caused by Europian colonialist today also W 3 cane because of colonialist Europian"
Kiev could look like Gaza. Russian has been restraining itself. The west keeps poking the Bear.
Russia is preparing nukes
"Standing side by side with the Russian leader Mr. president Vladimir Putin and with the Russian peace loving brave people from the IK Pakistan,"
FOR 4OOO KM OPERATION INTERCONTINENTAL BALLASTIC MISSILES MISSION ???
Trump will be feeling deflated because he wasn t in the loop. I d be watching for signs of a coordinated response between Putin and Trump. Neither have spoken so far.
Ukraine might already have thousands of drone hidden deep inside russia
Putin will not listen  why not listen to your friend and end the war
Now objectives of this war changed. What going to happen next is full invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
"This was hard to watch so bad all those planes .(Level of Ukrainian maneuver and personnel inside Russia is more alarming), peace now this is dangerous development."
"Why would you wait for an official response from the Kremlin? Both Putin, Peshkov and Lavrov officially in public made clear many times that every single word ever spoken in the history of mankind by a Russian politician is a 100% lie! So why would you wait for lies?"
That s why Russia doesn t want NATO to expand and refuses Ukraine NATO membership
Don t underestimate Ukraine
"Os ataques das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia aos aeródromos russos são consequências para o poder de ataque dos bombardeiros russos (no contexto dos ataques à Ucrânia)... Em geral, pode ser muito cedo para falar sobre isso, mas acho que alguns pontos devem ser explicados (já que o IPSO inimigo está tentando brincar no espaço da informação e dar o desejado como realidade). Para começar, o número de lados afetados. O inimigo cita o número de unidades 40, que supostamente representa 34% das aeronaves estratégicas russas. Agora, todos os infopomashiki ucranianos estão clamando sobre isso. É verdade que, depois de analisar todos os vídeos que ele postou ao mesmo tempo (e ele tem tudo, é claro, e não há razão para esconder a escala das perdas russas para ele — isso é óbvio), até agora contei um máximo de 5 lados de bombardeiros estratégicos Tu-95. Dois dos quais não podem ser restaurados. Além disso, outro il-20 (ou An-12 - provavelmente também já entrará em sucata). Em três Tu-95, os incêndios parecem locais e há chances de que, ao apagá-los a tempo, você possa tentar restaurá-los. As forças armadas russas da aeronave Tu-95 estavam armadas com unidades 58 até hoje de manhã. E mesmo se assumirmos que todos os cinco lados queimaram, isso será inferior a 10% da frota de Tu-95 (sem contar as unidades 19 de Tu-160 e 55 De Tu-22m3m, cujo vídeo de derrota não foi fornecido pelo inimigo). Sabe-se que dos ataques planejados a cinco aeródromos, apenas dois foram bem-sucedidos. Três aeronaves da aviação estratégica não foram danificadas. Assim, de acordo com dados confirmados, menos de 4% da frota de nossos estrategistas está desativada. E se você contar com bombardeiros pesados (apenas Tu-95 E Tu-160), então 6,5%. Agora vamos considerar a questão de quanto isso afetará os ataques que as forças aeroespaciais russas poderão infligir no território da Ucrânia. Propagandistas ucranianos, trabalhando não com cérebros, mas com uma calculadora e números de teto de perdas, que eles simplesmente inventaram, dizem que em um terço. Na verdade, não vai afetar e aqui está o porquê. O número de mísseis de cruzeiro KH-101 (a arma padrão do Tu-95, que eles usam em alvos na Ucrânia), que esta aeronave pode transportar simultaneamente unidades 8. Nos últimos ataques de tais mísseis, não mais do que 40 foram lançados simultaneamente. Isto é o carregamento de seis lados. Ou seja, basta que a Rússia tenha seis TU-95 MSM prontos para combate para que os ataques sejam realizados com a mesma intensidade que agora. E eles ficaram muitas vezes mais. E o Tu - 160 também não deve ser descontado. Até agora, eles não estão participando dos golpes. A razão é clara-estas são aeronaves mais novas, cujo recurso é preservado, e o tu-95MSM ainda ia ser gradualmente descartado em vista da velhice do projeto. E talvez a guerra atual para ele seja uma das últimas (de qualquer forma). E eu acho que durante o ataque de retaliação, que promete ser único, as forças aeroespaciais russas demonstrarão meus cálculos. O que se tornará um argumento mais convincente para os habitantes da Ucrânia do que a propaganda da mídia."
Man Russia has failed significantly.....
Donald said he doesn’t have the cards bluffed Donald bluffed ha ha.. fck russia
Now Ukrainians are speaking the Language of Putin...... Respect Ukraine 🇺🇦
did Russia know their air defence system was compromised to Israel by india for getting military support from Israel????
"This is Not a special operation by Ukraine, it is a special operation by NATO."
"As devestating as this was, you know Russia and the elite of Vladamir Putin are just going to look over their shoulders from here on out. Adding a very unnecessary and onerous pressure on Russia on top of everything else. Russia is in was could very likely be it doom spiral, Slava Ukraine!!!,"
34% of Russia s strategic air fleet taken out with toys you can buy from Sharper Image.
"How d that taste, Putin?"
Oreshniks should pay a visit to Germany France and Uk this attack has triggered a nuclear strike
this was for the AN-225. in my opinion.
I am worried for Ukraine now. Remember what happened to Japan after Pearl Harbor?
Only retards support dictator putin
Did some wake up Trump from his dementia stupor and let him know what happened.
"Great, Ukraine should exercise her power to defend herself."
All lies. They got hit way harder than they’re saying
Shades of grim Beeper attack
The patient did not sleep all night
Russia is gonna retaliate
Zelenski is about to feel it.
Ukrainians need to fund their own wars they are just welfare whores living off uncle sugar daddy sam
Now let s see the nuclear power nation how could respond....
"If half the details are true, someone in Ukraine played too much &quotAce Combat 7.&quot Check out the storyline for&quot Ace Combat 7&quot - its a 100% match. And half the military bois are stupid for thinking this is amazing."
Ukraine has choosen the path of destruction
Why is silent  russian president The country wants a permanent solution to this situation I remembered a scene from a movie Enemies are not only outside the country but also inside . Indian are always together Russian
"And the best thing about this special operation: Imagine what it does to ru logistics, are they going to search every truck within 20 km of every military base?  Ru is cooked!"
Russia got embarassed! Clown Putin crying in his bed tonight
The antinuclear agreement forbids hiding of the nuclear weapon carriers. That is why the airplanes were not in the hangars. NATO forces Russia to make another Hiroshima like Americans did for Pearl-Harbor. Nato pushes all of us in the nuclear war.
Ukraine presice targeting military areas while Putin targets civillian areas! Shame on Russia
Now that’s a “special operation “
What they are doing when all this happens
The true weakness of this battle is russia.bciz Ukraine attack military installation in russia.while Russia attack civilian in Ukraine.
No way CIA etc not involved.
Putin will choose ceasefire now.
This is US-NATO aided strikes on Russia
Zelensky a vile zionist who signed missiles in i Israel to kill Palestinians is a USA puppet and needs to be ousted!
The response will be very devastating and catastrophic.
Ukraine needs to be in charge of NATO.
"Ukraine has made a BIG mistake, alarming for the whole world."
"Not bad for a guy with no cards . What do you think, Donnie?"
What air defence doing?
An annoying lapse of security that makes for good Ukraine PR but which does nothing to stop Russia from achieving its SMO objectives.
"This is no Ukrain and Russian war, because Europe directly involved given weapons to Ukrain that shows &quotYou fight on behalf of us, we will give you what you need.&quot Ukrain coukd nkt stand this long if they were not getting funds and weapons. You get my point."
"That’s definitely done with the help Ukraine,NATO nd the US intelligence so heads up to all"
Ukraine has Trucks as their aircraft careers
Putin’s blood pressure is probably currently at 180/120.
So... I don t think the Russia-Ukraine war will be ended soon.
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,"
"I really don t understand the stupid weakling mentality of Ukrainians. Russia bombs the Ukrainian capital Kiev into 2077 Cyberpunk ruins every day with various missile drones As a result, Ukraine did not bomb the Russian capital Moscow, which is only 600 kilometers away from the Russian-Ukrainian border, or the second largest city St. Petersburg, which is 800 kilometers away, but went to bomb the Arctic Circle airport 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers away? Since they can smuggle a whole truck of suicide bomb drones to the Arctic Circle, can t they smuggle 20 trucks of suicide bomb drones to Moscow or St. Petersburg?"
Propaganda. Mainstream media is full of propaganda for the so called west. Lies sells better than truth. Report on what s happening in The Nation of Palestine.
"Attacking one of Russia nuclear triad means giving the reason for Russia to use tactical nuclear weapon in the war. Ukraine trying to get an upperhand before the negotiation but Russia will demand more as retaliation. Ukarine, NATO, and UK are fighting the losing war with Ukrainian lifes."
"“The fight is here I need ammunition, not a ride,” -Zelensky"
Slava Ukraini! Heroiam Slava!
"Well, at least nobody can blame Trump for knocking off 20% of the world’s GDP. Cause that is what could happen if Russia responds to this appropriately."
Russia trying to cover it up
My condolences to Russia. Such an embarrassment is hard to bear 🥲
"This is an American, British and NATO terror attack, just like Nordstream, on its own Ukraine cannot do this, this act is to degrade Russian nuclear capability."
Maybe Russia knew something was up so they Ukraine hard recently especially the drone factory
I guess this means the talks have failed already! I don t know why America is pushing for WW3.
"The Russian nuclear legs are getting shorter. Soon they won t have one of three if Ukraine keeps destroying their bombers. Ukraine also attacked one nuclear sub, working on the second leg of Russia s nuclear capabilities."
lol now westerners will cry when there will be no ukraine
This is America’s response to Putin jerking them around ! Ukraine does nothing without Trump giving the nod and helps with targeting etc
Operation Spider s Web
Do you mean children that were kidnapped according to the international law??
Ukrainians are Zionist and J ews. Do your research? President Putin is a world leader 🇷🇺 I love Russia 🇷🇺. Ukraine president is an Isrealihell demon 
"Well, let’s not complain when Russia hit back!"
Russia has drugged this war so when you stupid u pay the price. Embarrassing nothing else
"During soviet time, Ukraine produced thousands of scientists, huge industrial capabilities. And putin really belived that everything will go smoothly. In 5 years stalin took berlin, in 4 years putin cant take kharkiv which is in 20 kilometres from russian border. Total joke"
The war will escalate this year.
India still holds the record of destroying 11 air bases in one operation. Ukraine trying their best with support from European allies. TAcO man will do a ceasefire just like he made between india and pakistan.
Your lower third is wrong. The Irkurtsk base is the far one. Murmansk is less than the 4300KM.
A Demilitarisation of Russia is going on by the plan
Amrica Israel jenoside in Gaza
World waar 3 starts amrica
And putin and 🇷🇺 still call nato patners very disgusting
Pootin said a 6 day operation! Its been 3 years!
Rossia will retaliate with the :&quotFront yellow back-down brown men underwear operation&quot.
"When you mess with Ukraine, you take the consequences. Now because of Putin, nowhere in Russia is safe. Nowhere."
"You got my attention and I am very proud you’re wise and very talented ( you &amp your team are brave dangerous to take on the current administration). If you didn’t announce this video and “fact check “ type of presentation, others are scared to do so. I pray for you and your team. We need your wisdom and bravery."
"Only 40? Ukraine should have said 100, since these clowns are just taking them at their word"
Something big is going to happen after this. Something so positive or something so bad.
"Vientos hijos de huracanes se avecinan por el Este, hacía los fabricantes de violencias y muertes de los &quotMaidanes&quot. De sus arrogancias de fuerzas, ¿quién prevalecerá si deciden jugarse el todo o nada con sus dones omnipotentes y bestiales? Lo impasible, indiferente, despertará en pesadilla de sus sueños displicentes. Mientras colapsan y caen al abismo las corroídas añejas estatuas de imperiales egoísmos infernales, arrastrando raíces y bases con esclavos ancestrales, su patética agonía con sus típicas muertes colosales."
"putin wanted this war and thinks nothing of killing innocent civilians, it is not quite so funny when it hits hard deep in russia,, putin can stop the war tomorrow if he wants but wont just to save his own ego."
Done by US in the name of Ukraine
Rest assured Putin will not be humiliated. WW3 is coming soon.
A very intelligent operation against military targets. Big difference from invader Putin who cowardly attacks sleeping civilians during the nights. Which is a war crime
US-NATO-Ukraine attacks on Russia not helpful. What if they return the favor ? What then?
Slava Ukraine. 
so there are ukrainian drone operators inside russia?
There shouldn t have been such a strong attack during the negotiations. It looks like the war will escalate towards Europe instead of ending.
"Ukraine attacks military bases, Russia attacks civilian houses, hospitals, schools, etc."
Enjoy Russia this is what s called a special military operation
I think instead of an intelligence agency Russia has an agency of stupidity probably or everyone there is drunk
Putin is responsible for these escalations
"Ukraine has given its &quotMinerals&quot to USA, maybe that s why usa is helping Ukraine now."
You never want to strike a war with neighboring countries. I don t care who you are.
Once again Russia has shown levels of incompetence that are hard to ignore whether it was the invasion of cursed that they seemingly didn t know anything about before it happened or the latest attack on airfields and other examples can be given and you have to wonder why how in God s name a country can allow this to happen when they are at War no wonder this war is going on and on like it has for the Great and Powerful nation that Russia is or is supposed to be these things keep happening and this last one is a really big setback for them let s make no doubt about it
Losing 40 planes in one day is huge.🇯🇲
"This is a lesson for President Putin to trust the West, especially America. They have done this kind of thing in the past. They stab us in the back by calling for an end to the war."
Without western collaboration it’s not possible
Russian military is pathetic. Shame
"The responsible to sabotage tomorrow s talks in Turkey, is USA and the stupid Ukrainian so called presfient. He has bring the destruction very near of the area."
Guess Russia FAFO.
It was Trump who gave the order to bomb Russia to such depths in Siberia and Murmansk. It s obvious. Putin is a coward under the thumb of Trump and his neocons.
Dangerous development because Ukraine fights back? Only Russian plants are able to speak such utter nonsense. How much is Kremlin paying her?
I wish our US president was even half the man Zelensky is.
They used bombers to start Ukraine? I thought they used rockets and drones?
Behind every war there is Israiel if that is in Arab that is in Asia funding and supporting India for war and in Europe funding and supporting ukrine
I think this attack is made through the shift of USA’s policy on Russia. Trump’s gone back not attacking putin
"It is sad and shame for Russians, why Russia to move its NUK?"
Selva prove he always there for his country and people 
ALL supplied by NATO-US. Our corrupted and controlled US politicians are supporting and funding 2 evil wars and want to start a 3rd with Iran
The war came home to Russia.
"They could not do it Without US/ NATO drones , explosives and intel , and more than likely , NATO operators . When will Putin go a pair and take the gloves off ? He has to !"
"Ukraina is clever , smart to not waste simply ammo blind defend they homeland ...."
Is this an escalation to nuclear war?
Ukraine crossed the red line. The night can be tough for Ukraine now
"West is playing with fire, they want Russia to nuke Europe"
NATO attack. Gonna be consequences.
"While we have a traitor in the White House here, the Ukrainians are taking it to the Russian Military who keeps sending an average of over 1,000 soldiers to their death in Ukraine. Way to go Ukraine!!"
Looks like the Iskander will take revenge
Gloves are off. Ukraine will pay dearly for this.
Get up Ivan!
Putin is worried not to post the truth on media .Embarrassing for Putin and Ukraine don’t attack civilians like Russians
While Ukraine targeted airbase and aircraft now Russia will target civilian infrastructure and apartments
Russia have same defence system they give to India and when Pakistan hit Indian Rafael world and Ukraine found out this systems weakness now Russia should ask India and India should ask Russia meanwhile China is chilling with Pakistan and others😅
And Trump says he didn t know. The President of the US didn t know. Bet the CIIA did. World War 3 is coming to the West s backyard.
"Ukraine has no such technology or capacity,so the west is behind,WWII inevitable"
next time ..... zelensky will be crying for ceasefire bcoz kyiv was attacked heavily
Can we call it The Day of Russian Aviation?
The only way Puter understands.
"This is the sign that Russians are playing soft in this war, while NATO and Ukraine are on War. Why Russia are playing nice to Ukraine and NATO"
This is indeed called Russia is being “Demilitarisation” by Ukraine 
happy retards are not able to predict the respond
"its mean, Russian will start WW3? did the drone is giving by US/ Europe to Ukraine?"
The weather forecast says it will be very hot in Ukraine next days
Response will be disastrous. Stop celebrating.
This is clear stupidity of Comedian Zelensky
Ukraine shd stop poking the dragon
"Overseen by Zelensky personally remember the outrageous conduct of Trump you don t have the cards , this is historic. Congratulations to Ukraine and war-time hero Zelensky."
I am gonna call this operation Tandoor. not Sindoor 
"NATO is putting a fight with anyone or any country that do not support its interest. NATO wants to rule the world and wanted everyone bow to it. NATO is no democracy and human rights. NATO cries for democracy and human rights if these benefit it. If democracy and human rights run counter to its interest, NATO is the greatest dictatorship and authoritarian alliance in disguise. NATO loses moral credibility. It has become an alliance of arrogance and wickedness. Many wars in Europe and elsewhere were created, instigated and promoted by NATO."
Israel the mastermind. Remember Israel was saying they will come for Russia
Regardless of where these attacks originated i don t see any excuse for not properly protecting those bases but maybe I m wrong
Al Jazeera deleting comments
War will escalate
Putin taking too long to long to flatten Ukraine . All show and no real substance.
Slava Ukraine!
Complete failure of Russian intelligence.
Nothing new. They been fighting for many years now so much property &amp lives gone but nothing new its all waste of lives money etc at the end of the day everything will be gone
"Dear Father, please give the Ukraine 🇺🇦 the strength of David, in Jesus name I pray, Amen"
The PutinBots and cowardly american MAGA knee-benders are seething in the comments right now lmao.
Nato is playing with fire..
Putin s softness is Russia s weakness..
trump : wow amazing wow
"Watching From South Africa,the people of Ukraine must let there president step down,to much people gonna die now over this strike,i wish this can come to end."
"It s not Ukrainian work, but CIA &amp Mi involve..."
"Do people today still think that drone attack was done by Ukraine? It is unbelievable. On the other hand, the signature id NATO is present and it is behind this attack."
"All these Ukraine bots in the comments . This has US and UK Intel hands all over it. This means nothing, Russia is still winning this war at an alarming kill rate."
Sorry for Ukrainians
This is of course Nato s operation in the name of Ukraine...
I can see the outrage when the reply hits
"Zelensky told to poutine to stop or you will regret, now who have the cards hey Donald "
Poohtin worshipping trolls are getting mad 
Kiev doesn t want any peace. Ok.
Agent Krasnov told Zelenskyy in the White House: “You’ve got no cards!” Now Putin just lost most of his cards! Putin just FAFO! Ukraine’s little SMO!
Putin wants to take over Ukraine or if he can’t he will pound it to dust like Gaza or Syria .
"I am waiting to see how the Russian talking heads, the scott ritters, and rest will Spin this"
When you play with destruction with your neighbour you must expect the same reaction from them . All of Ukraine was once the Russia Empire as was Poland Before WW2 most countries had integrated populations Putin and Zelenskyy should make part of Russia neutral and part of Ukraine neutral so they can live together in harmony.
Well how s that going to affect Trump s expertise at peace negotiations? Send TACO TRUMP in the mix.
Now when Russia wil response they all will play victim card
"Just imagine... you are a russian soldier, chilling at an airbase 4300km away from war and suddenly everything around you explodes."
How can you not mention the 1400 missiles launched by Ukraine into Russia in the weeks prior to the Russian escalation? Or the assassination attempt on Putin?
Using a disguised civilian truck to enter enemy territory and deploy FPV drones for attacks would constitute perfidy and be a violation of the Geneva Conventions. It could be classified as a war crime.
"I am starting to believe, the formidable KGB that we thought were Russians were almost all Ukrainians"
"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, are you a member of the secret society skull and bones aka brotherhood of death?"
Ukraine can not do this alone.
Why is Russia trying to destroy ukraine?
"This is certainly a very successful operation carried out by Ukraine. It is not exactly like Pearl Harbor, but it is a very painful blow to the pride of the Bear and Moscow. But now, of course, after such an event, no one can talk about a truce at all, at least in the near future between Moscow and Kiev. Kyiv has certainly added fuel to the fire. It is possible that many countries will probably soon, if not ban, then at least limit the production and use of FPV drones. Earlier, I wrote that the president or high-ranking official of any country is no longer safe, despite the fact that they are well guarded. Can you imagine a well-planned action using drones against anyone or anything? I also wrote that with the help of such drones, one can effectively attack military bases, industrial centers and warehouses with goods, although previously these quadcopters were produced exclusively as a peaceful gadget and a toy for adults. It should be noted that politicians, businessmen and other interested parties who control the production of very expensive aircraft of various types and profit from their sales may also be concerned and against the further spread of such literally penny drones, which may minimize their greedy plans to profit from the sale of human-controlled aircraft, which in most cases are unreasonably expensive military aircraft with questionable efficiency, as practice shows. That is, by advertising such new samples of super-duper technologies to the public, as if these are new technologies that the country can be proud of, and as if they provide new jobs. But in fact, these lying and greedy people make money at the expense of taxpayers money by providing false information. ..."
I am pretty sure this was done by British MI6 and French Special Forces. Ukraine has no more soldiers left
Donald trump is forcing russia to negotiation table
"Russian: plz buy Indian defence system which neutralized 99.9% of drones missiles from Pakistan. It has integrated all radars ranges, interceptor, missiles with central control unit called AKASHTEER. It integrated S400, BARAK, AKASH, L70 in one system. This is better than iron dome, patriot."
"Russia being humbled in the most embarrassing way. Zelensky is the modern world’s greatest wartime leader. The burden this man carries in so many respects, including overseeing this operation. How dare Trump and JD Vance belittle him the way they did."
"This was Nato attacking Russia nuclear triad not Ukraine. This was never a Ukraine war and it was always a Nato war. They are trying to take out Russia nuclear bombers to pave the way for a nuclear decapitation strike that will happen under Trump. He hinted at that already. Let s be honest, the war is not ending, it is advancing to the final round which will be a nuclear apocalypse. This is all part odmf a Demonic plan by the west to bring about the end of the world."
Wait for Russia s retaliation
So if the rockets fly to Kiev in large amounts stop crying about it
This is a sign of 3rd world war
I bet you the Americans had nothing to do with this..
Putin should of taken that ceasefire. Ukrainians just got themselves a bargining chip because thats only 40% of its bomber fleet
"not blaming israel for this...? what s the matter? do you feel ok....AL JAZEERA? need some tea? 31dead in aid center is gaza is israel, Ha? HAMAS IS MASSACARING IS OWN PEOPLE, and you blame israel for this. even when arabs butcher... other arabsm israel is blamed."
Tom Cruise has aged significantly since the release of the last Mission Impossible movie. 🫣
Putin got caught with his pants down. That s what happens when you have a boyfriend named Donny Trump. Gloria to Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Some news to say Ukraine still alive. Loser country now begging Russia.
The putlerism-neonazism will fall. People are fed up with putlerism-neonazism and trumpism-neofascism
The ukranian bots d*ck riding on the chat is funny
I think putting will know he has lost this special operation. Military assets is gone.
Muslim traitor in russia
Ukraine with the active assistance of the West is trying to attack the Russian military assets to weaken it. Russia should abandon the policy of restraint before it s too late.
"I have never seen a country full of FOOLS and JOKERS. Ukrain do no even know what they are fighting for. They lost 50% resources to USA. And now, invited more devastations again..what for? USA Supremacy..Ego of one ruling joker is costing lives in Ukrain"
Those children (russian speaking) have been evacuated from the war zones
Childrens wrre shaved from the sries that russia INVADED....uts like robers just saving money from a robbery the are convinced
This war will not end soon 
"Had Russian intelligence been apprised of Ukraine s plans, they would have found them utterly improbable."
That State of the art Russian S400-500-600 missile defence system is really getting a good return on its investment.
"One thing Russians should understand is, there will be no peace in their country if any part of Ukraine is taken. No part of Russia will be safe as Ukrainians will be scattered everywhere."
Ukrainian are real worriers
Ironically we never saw russia hitting Ukrainian bases.. In the media only Russia hit civilians but Ukraine only hits the bases
Nato trying to make the perfect drone so they don t stop war
"The prove Ukraine never stop bombing, or making terror act in Russia killing civilians. Expired Zelenskie do everything not making Peace deal at all. And always playing victim."
I know two things 1-That attack made by USA-UK cooperation. 2-Russia s response will be scary!
Who provided this location? Russia have rights to take bold step.
Why don t the Russian people / soldiers rally/ protest for Putin to stop the war?
wow amazing russian air defense. the most incompetent army in the world lmao
It will be nice from here Hopefully Zelensky n the west will not say anything about Russia retaliation
"Reports have said four airfields. However footedge shows aircraft NOT in revetments which is just foolish when on a wartime footing. Foolish, incredulous to the point of making any reporting accurate"
The operation was called WEB. Change one letter in the Ukrainian word for web and replace with U and you ll get Putin.
"ARE YOU ALL OUT OF YOUR MINDS? WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO START WW3? TOTAL ANNIHILATION, MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION, CAN YOU GUYS ALL CHILL? WE JUST WANT TO LIVE OUR LIVES STILL."
"let us list the facts and you can decide who you think is winning in the Russo-Ukraine war. Russia invaded and occupied 38% of Ukraine in early 2022, but by October 22 after retreating in the east and up to today in 2025 they only managed to hang on to just 17%. That s a decrease in the Russian temporarily occupied territories of 61%% ! (in real terms Russia in 3 years has only captured 10% new territory in Ukraine. here s why that s a fact - In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea - 4.7% of Ukraine. between 2015 &amp 2021 Russia occupied part of Donetsk (Donbas) - 2.3% of Ukraine, that equals 7% already occupied, prior to the 2022 invasion, meaning Russia has only captured 10% new territory in 3yrs 3months of war ! 😳 😲) Russia got defeated at Kyiv and had to retreat back to Belarus ! Russia got defeated in Sumi and Kharkiv and ran away into Kursk and Belgorod leaving millions of tons of equipment for Ukraine ! Russia got defeated in Kherson and had to retreat back across the Dnieper River ! Ukraine invades Kursk in Russia and captures in 9 days, more territory than Russia captured in Donbas over 2 years ! who do you think is winning the land war? Ukraine made Sevastapol in Crimea untenable for the Black Sea Fleet, making them leave their major regional naval base ! Ukraine has in dock and on the open sea sunk or neutralised 450,000 tons of Russia s black sea fleet, approx 67% of the fleet is unusable! Ukrainian activities in the Black Sea has forced the Russian black sea fleet to retreat all the way (600km east) to Novorossiysk in Russia. The Russian black sea fleet has barricaded itself inside Novorossiysk harbour to stop drones attacks from Ukraine, scared to come out. Ukraine has made the Black and Azov Seas untenable for Russia s mighty black sea fleet and taken control the Black Sea region. who do you think is winning the sea war ? Russia s air space force in January 2022 was 7 times bigger than Ukraine s. Russia has lost 408 planes, 392 helicopters and 616 pilots in 3 years 3 months of war. Russian airforce won t fly in Ukraine air space for fear of being shot down by Ukraine s air defence systems. in 3 years 3 months of war, out numbering Ukraine s air force 7 : 1, Russia HAS NOT managed to take control of Ukraine s airspace. Russia can t make enough planes to replace those being shot down or destroyed, but Ukraine has received new planes from their supporters. so who do you think is winning the air war? on top of this Russian casualties currently exceed 990,000+ soldiers and military equipment losses over 160,000+ pieces. You might want to re-evaluate your understanding of what has been going on and who s winning this fight!"
"Amazing operation. The Ukrainians carry out crazier missions every month and this has to be their masterpiece so far. The ocs were so worried about long distance large drones that they missed the trucks parked next to the airfields with small drones. Over 40 russian planes destroyed so far, and most likely, there are more. It s crazy how a small country that s only 35 years old can become a world leader in modern warfare in 4 years out of necessity. Drone warfare is the latest of modern warfare and Ukrainiane is the leader. Sure, America and other countries have big drones, but i would rather have a million small and cheap drones than a 1000 large drones. Large drones are not disposable and expensive and can be spotted on radar so naturaly the owners will keep it out of any risky situations while small drones are disposable and you can use a dozen of them on a single target."
This seems like more an airfield special military operation
Jocker has struck a hammer on his own toes
"When Russia gives the same favour back to Ukraine, Zelensky will start to cry out"
RIP Ukraine now it s really going to humiliating for your country
"Excellent. And, as opposed to Russia, they didn t attack civilians."
"Stupid. Ask yourself this : White Christians killing White Christians, who benefits ?"
This is a big blow to o Putin.....so he thinks he can fight with NATO
Trump will cry for his criminal friend Putin 
Can Ukraine Sustain a Retaliatory Attack by Russia After this Provocation?
This will make Russia stronger not weaker.
This couldn t happen without specialist western help specifically targeting and operational aid. So when Russ14 decides to hit back hard watch the West cry and scream foul. This war is being made worse and kept going because of the west. Idiots
DEMOCRACY is action.
"Where was air defense ? these drones are doing what 5 squadrons of fighter jets could not do, maybe this event will change war fighting strategies on out. How do you protect air fields against drones??"
"H-3 airstrike, Ukraine edition. This strike is equivalent to the Iranian airstrike on the H-3 airbase during the Iran-Iraq war."
Are they going to turkey again for peace talk?
SURRENDER NOW WIN YOUR STATE HOOD
Nuclear was in two weeaks
"These planes are called the Bear long range nuclear bombers, some reports say 40 were destroyed."
Now watch out for Oreshnik rockets
"Ukraine is helping Russia join the peace talks, nice of them."
Now world knows .. who is the real joker
USA double game playing
Russia will respond in a big way of course.
Ukrainian military intelligence is no joke
"Putin might not be happy and will counter big while grabbing more lands. Ceasefire wont happen anytime soon, only either 1 surrender."
Trump i will stop the war day 1 but bs we already going to WW3 UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINITRATION WW3 WILL START UNDER THEM WHYYYYYYYY
Russia must not spare Ukraine.Putin must go in hard otherwise he will regret
Norway. Murmansk is close to Norway border.
This is the sign of weakness of Russia!! Now we know that Russia is not a Superpower country!! Very poor defense ang too much poor war strategies!!!
I guess Ukraine does have some pretty good cards…
It s not Ukraine But NATO. This cannot be done with NATO nations participation of course.
"So, a NATO operation using special operators entering and exiting the country from either Finland or the Baltics."
Well return on investment.. Russia said it is demilitarizing Ukraine. Now who is being demilitarized?
Finland must have helped.
Putin must be no happy
MILITARY VS MILITARY NOT LIKE GAZA
Wait for the retaliation by Russia.
"There are videos out that show drones being launched from the trailers of semi-trucks. They drove them all the way there, and the tops of the trailers opened up and launched the drones. Wild."
I wonder what the response will be. Has Ukraine gone too far. We will see the outcome soon
"Nothing about this attack makes sense. Big planes aren’t used widely anymore. Plus, radar was not tracking anything? Plus they left them parked like it’s an air show? Sounds like an allowed red flag…"
"No matter how strong you are, you aren t fighting unless your opponent is fighting back. Anything less is bullying, oppression, abuse, and cowardice, and nothing more."
This will only force Russia to escalate.
I am afraid what Putin going to reply.
"The West is continuously provoking and sabotaging and therefore wants the third world war, not peace!!"
"This is an interesting concept of &quotfight for freedom.&quot Being so far away from the front means that this is out of bounds on any means. I wonder what retaliation will be. Of course let us not forget that the goal of this ardent attack is to spread fear and derail any peace process. A peace process that is not mutual. It is a pity that people rejoice at terror acts and killing of other people. Watching it from the armchair as if this was some kind of a TV contest. And even if everything goes well, the average person gets the fallout from any military action. Those at the affected villages and cities will tell the real truth. Those who rejoice forget that their taxes go to kill other people instead of developing their own countries. This is like the Game of Thrones. Watching a movie with a sick content and even paying for it.... I advise all of the happy people to go to Ukraine or Russia and see what is truly happening. All the media is doing is inciting brothers and sisters to kill each other, so that the third party can have the benefits of the misery of the other two."
Ukraine is finished it s made a big mistake
USA sponsored wars are a threat to all of. They are so stupid to tempt Putin s patience.
Ukraine is helping Russia demilitarize
zelansky is a moron he doesn t want peace if he did he would provoke Putin
This reminds me pearl harbour. Hope this conflict ends here.
Allah akbar ! 🇺🇦🇺🇦
"Ukraine, be Israel, Say nothing, confirm nothing"
Ukraine could keep this secret for a year because the only war on msm is Gaza
No more Ukraine personal opinion
"Russia is the most weirdest country I have ever seen in my life. Beyond comprehension. You can t believe how stupid the inhabitants are, if there was a drone swarm in direction to moscow the people would still act like there is nothing happening literally brain dead. If russia didn t have any nukes they would loose on every front. The US would annihilate them."
Russia: don t look up. also Russia: FAFO
Russia will respond by targeting none military targets . They will do terrorism in response...
Russia is not ready for this.
Would be interested to hear a dollar value assessment of the damage. Has to be huge
I Am indian but suport gaza jay hind
Where is S 400 air defense...... India can protect from Pakistan....why not Russia so funny
Red flag russian inside job
Time for Russia to retaliate!!!
This is distance London and Moscow it is impossible
"Trump is fooling Putin and the power who run america behind walls want wars zelensky natanyahu both r puppets of this power, in short zionist is trying to implement Israel new world order these zionist extremist is also pushing poor modi for war, people should see the prediction in Jews holy books and compulsory watch DR.Israr Ahmed lectures in YouTube"
Ukraine is clearly badassforsure.
Ukraine are playing with the tail of a lion expect the worst from Russia....
The operation was next level. And Trump said Ukraine has no cards.
Stop the war save the children &amp woman both sides.we want to peace M Iqbal from USA philidhalipa N 7 street
And then there will be a respond and.......the cycle continues
This is a very dangerous step taken by Ukraine. Russia can even drop a nuclear weapon any moment.
To all Ukrainian fans. Look at the map and just shut up. Losers cheering all day long.
"The Istanbul talks are just a way for Russia to give the orange r@pist a way to say Russia wants peace and then blame Ukraine for not surrendering to all the demands. Anyone with over 4 brain cells knows the only peace Russia wants is for half of Europe to surrender to the Tsar, starting with Ukraine. Shame on USA for supporting Russia."
Those airplanes were moved to those locations far from the Ukrainian border to protect them from theese kind of attacks…you can call it a major score…
At that moment Russian media large amount of it is calling for nuclear retaliation &quot World is going insane ? Peace is only answers !
Trump: You don t have the cards Zelensky: Hold my beer
Ukraine is a surrogate of USA. Trump is now playing a dangerous game.
4 bases at once…that’s a slapdown
Zelensky is war monger man.Never wants peace in the world.
The Russian Air bases successfully intercepted incoming missiles and drones.
Launched nearby. C I A. Seems US Deep State has enlisted Trump. Ukraine hasnt any capability to launch drones within Russia. Only a combo of CIA and US Air Force could infiltrate Russian air bases.
"Zelensky, the comedian, Mr. Putin, is also Zelensky the script writer! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA "
We all believe garbage Ukraine. Propaganda from losing country. Fake country losing land everyday and no option than now beg Russia for peace.
Russia s big mistake is attacking civilians. That s why people support Ukraine. Russian s will never recover under Putin.
"Military targets , military targets , military targets , Ukraine attacks military targets NOT civilian targets 🇬🇧🇺🇦"
Free Ukraine 🇺🇦 Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Ukrainian drone attack??? You mean NATO drone attack. Trump effectively shot down Ukraines access to Elon Musks SpaceX spy satellite surveillance of Russian territory. So stop this nonsense about Ukraines capability to hit targets deeb inside Russia +4000 km from Ukrainian boarders. It s a NATO EU lead operation. Pure and simple.
Putin looking weak af. Russia needs a stronger leader
Retaliation from Russia is a big concern now.
I always emphasize that Russian only boasts about nukes and commencing WWW3 and have no other agenda.
18 months in planning? Could this so called war be any more protracted?
Zelensky has the scalpel at Putins testicles!....
Zelensky destroying Ukraine to make happy USAGermany France UK sacrificing Ukraine military personals and Citizens to weaken Russia but Zelensky not thinking about Russia s Heavy Retaliation which is Nuclear Power... Ukraine Citizens must pull down Zelensky from Power to save Ukraine to be occupied Fully by Russia
Stop the old zar wanna be now!
"Russia needs to make some Ukrainian glass, green-glass."
Russia is s winner country
People love to write off the Ukrainians and then they just keep proving them wrong this is massive imagine if America had half their nuclear bombers destroyed on the ground amazing
This could lead all of us to WWII
Israel behind ukrane training
War will continiue now.
Russia must be thinking whos helping from within
David and Goliath comes to mind but instead of a stone it s a drone 
to bad trump wasn t there with his boy putie
This here is about pushed Putin to the edge. If he does not make mess now his ppl won’t understand him anymore. And nato was trying hard to achieve it Whoever called this shots is the one who wants to prevent peace at all cost Probably dollar owners They got beautiful luxury bunkers for their families
Ukrain is committing suicide!
"Everyone, just all go home."
This is civil war now.
putin s 2 week special military operation isnt going so well
mandatory military draft for all white european men NOW!
Wasn’t Trump supposed to stop the war in 24 hours ?
"Who has gone crazy now,, "
I wonder why chyna isnt helping russia
"Hey Russia, how is your 3 day Special military operation coming along ???? hahahah"
They will cry to America when Russia retaliates
HOW EMBARASSING RUSSIA haahahahaha
Isn’t this a war crime?
They will cry to America when Russia retaliates
There is no appetite for peace here. This war is about to go nuclear.
Ukraine’s just responding with the only language Russia understands
The West will keep fighting for the Russian resources to the last Ukrainian.
Russian army is the nr. 2 army in...Russia (after Ukraine).
Putin is Disaster for Russia 🇷🇺.Free Russia 🇷🇺 from Putin
The war began in 2014 when the Ukrainian military began shelling the Russian speaking population of Donbass
Ukraine just committed suicide.
Putin will not finish the year.
This is what happens when you invade another man s land. Russia should ask for peace. It s time for a peace deal.
ukies celebrating small victories then cry on 10x larger scale consequences: Russia is cruel
Kremlin Russia continues to cultivate disastrous karma.
The EU and Trump are Quite now he couldn t say anything again now he doesn t See or Hear what Terrorist actions Zelensky and his goons are doing
These attacks were co ordinated by The West ....
And why did ukraine just smaggled the drones into russia then strikes when their near by airport!why dint they just deploy then inside ukraine into russia
Those Children we re forced into the army who didn t see videos of ppl even as 14yrs being forced to go fight to the front....
And that s the difference between Russia who bombs civilians and Ukriane who bombs the bombers bombing the civilians.
Some news to say Ukraine still alive. Loser country now begging Russia.
The putlerism-neonazism will fall. People are fed up with putlerism-neonazism and trumpism-neofascism

"Nothing about this attack makes sense. Big planes aren’t used widely anymore. Plus, radar was not tracking anything? Plus they left them parked like it’s an air show? Sounds like an allowed red flag…"
"No matter how strong you are, you aren t fighting unless your opponent is fighting back. Anything less is bullying, oppression, abuse, and cowardice, and nothing more."
This will only force Russia to escalate.
I am afraid what Putin going to reply.
"The West is continuously provoking and sabotaging and therefore wants the third world war, not peace!!"
"This is an interesting concept of &quotfight for freedom.&quot Being so far away from the front means that this is out of bounds on any means. I wonder what retaliation will be. Of course let us not forget that the goal of this ardent attack is to spread fear and derail any peace process. A peace process that is not mutual. It is a pity that people rejoice at terror acts and killing of other people. Watching it from the armchair as if this was some kind of a TV contest. And even if everything goes well, the average person gets the fallout from any military action. Those at the affected villages and cities will tell the real truth. Those who rejoice forget that their taxes go to kill other people instead of developing their own countries. This is like the Game of Thrones. Watching a movie with a sick content and even paying for it.... I advise all of the happy people to go to Ukraine or Russia and see what is truly happening. All the media is doing is inciting brothers and sisters to kill each other, so that the third party can have the benefits of the misery of the other two."
Ukraine is finished it s made a big mistake
USA sponsored wars are a threat to all of. They are so stupid to tempt Putin s patience.
Ukraine is helping Russia demilitarize
zelansky is a moron he doesn t want peace if he did he would provoke Putin
This reminds me pearl harbour. Hope this conflict ends here.
Allah akbar ! 🇺🇦🇺🇦
"Ukraine, be Israel, Say nothing, confirm nothing"
Ukraine could keep this secret for a year because the only war on msm is Gaza
No more Ukraine personal opinion
"Russia is the most weirdest country I have ever seen in my life. Beyond comprehension. You can t believe how stupid the inhabitants are, if there was a drone swarm in direction to moscow the people would still act like there is nothing happening literally brain dead. If russia didn t have any nukes they would loose on every front. The US would annihilate them."
Russia: don t look up. also Russia: FAFO
Russia will respond by targeting none military targets . They will do terrorism in response...
Russia is not ready for this.
Would be interested to hear a dollar value assessment of the damage. Has to be huge
I Am indian but suport gaza jay hind
Where is S 400 air defense...... India can protect from Pakistan....why not Russia so funny
Red flag russian inside job
Time for Russia to retaliate!!!
This is distance London and Moscow it is impossible
"Trump is fooling Putin and the power who run america behind walls want wars zelensky natanyahu both r puppets of this power, in short zionist is trying to implement Israel new world order these zionist extremist is also pushing poor modi for war, people should see the prediction in Jews holy books and compulsory watch DR.Israr Ahmed lectures in YouTube"
Ukraine is clearly badassforsure.
Ukraine are playing with the tail of a lion expect the worst from Russia....
The operation was next level. And Trump said Ukraine has no cards.
Stop the war save the children &amp woman both sides.we want to peace M Iqbal from USA philidhalipa N 7 street
And then there will be a respond and.......the cycle continues
This is a very dangerous step taken by Ukraine. Russia can even drop a nuclear weapon any moment.
To all Ukrainian fans. Look at the map and just shut up. Losers cheering all day long.
"The Istanbul talks are just a way for Russia to give the orange r@pist a way to say Russia wants peace and then blame Ukraine for not surrendering to all the demands. Anyone with over 4 brain cells knows the only peace Russia wants is for half of Europe to surrender to the Tsar, starting with Ukraine. Shame on USA for supporting Russia."
Those airplanes were moved to those locations far from the Ukrainian border to protect them from theese kind of attacks…you can call it a major score…
At that moment Russian media large amount of it is calling for nuclear retaliation &quot World is going insane ? Peace is only answers !
Trump: You don t have the cards Zelensky: Hold my beer
Ukraine is a surrogate of USA. Trump is now playing a dangerous game.
4 bases at once…that’s a slapdown
Zelensky is war monger man.Never wants peace in the world.
The Russian Air bases successfully intercepted incoming missiles and drones.
Launched nearby. C I A. Seems US Deep State has enlisted Trump. Ukraine hasnt any capability to launch drones within Russia. Only a combo of CIA and US Air Force could infiltrate Russian air bases.
"Zelensky, the comedian, Mr. Putin, is also Zelensky the script writer! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
We all believe garbage Ukraine. Propaganda from losing country. Fake country losing land everyday and no option than now beg Russia for peace.
Russia s big mistake is attacking civilians. That s why people support Ukraine. Russian s will never recover under Putin.
"Military targets , military targets , military targets , Ukraine attacks military targets NOT civilian targets 🇬🇧🇺🇦"
Free Ukraine 🇺🇦 Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Ukrainian drone attack??? You mean NATO drone attack. Trump effectively shot down Ukraines access to Elon Musks SpaceX spy satellite surveillance of Russian territory. So stop this nonsense about Ukraines capability to hit targets deeb inside Russia +4000 km from Ukrainian boarders. It s a NATO EU lead operation. Pure and simple.
Putin looking weak af. Russia needs a stronger leader
Retaliation from Russia is a big concern now.
I always emphasize that Russian only boasts about nukes and commencing WWW3 and have no other agenda.
18 months in planning? Could this so called war be any more protracted?
Zelensky has the scalpel at Putins testicles!....
Zelensky destroying Ukraine to make happy USAGermany France UK sacrificing Ukraine military personals and Citizens to weaken Russia but Zelensky not thinking about Russia s Heavy Retaliation which is Nuclear Power... Ukraine Citizens must pull down Zelensky from Power to save Ukraine to be occupied Fully by Russia
Stop the old zar wanna be now!
"Russia needs to make some Ukrainian glass, green-glass."
Russia is s winner country
People love to write off the Ukrainians and then they just keep proving them wrong this is massive imagine if America had half their nuclear bombers destroyed on the ground amazing
This could lead all of us to WWII
Israel behind ukrane training
War will continiue now.
Russia must be thinking whos helping from within
David and Goliath comes to mind but instead of a stone it s a drone 
to bad trump wasn t there with his boy putie
This here is about pushed Putin to the edge. If he does not make mess now his ppl won’t understand him anymore. And nato was trying hard to achieve it Whoever called this shots is the one who wants to prevent peace at all cost Probably dollar owners They got beautiful luxury bunkers for their families
Ukrain is committing suicide!
"Everyone, just all go home."
This is civil war now.
putin s 2 week special military operation isnt going so well
mandatory military draft for all white european men NOW!
Wasn’t Trump supposed to stop the war in 24 hours ?
"Who has gone crazy now,, "
I wonder why chyna isnt helping russia
"Hey Russia, how is your 3 day Special military operation coming along ???? hahahah"
They will cry to America when Russia retaliates
HOW EMBARASSING RUSSIA haahahahaha
Isn’t this a war crime?
They will cry to America when Russia retaliates
There is no appetite for peace here. This war is about to go nuclear.
Ukraine’s just responding with the only language Russia understands
The West will keep fighting for the Russian resources to the last Ukrainian.
Russian army is the nr. 2 army in...Russia (after Ukraine).
Putin is Disaster for Russia 🇷🇺.Free Russia  from Putin
The war began in 2014 when the Ukrainian military began shelling the Russian speaking population of Donbass 
Ukraine just committed suicide.
Putin will not finish the year.
This is what happens when you invade another man s land. Russia should ask for peace. It s time for a peace deal.
ukies celebrating small victories then cry on 10x larger scale consequences: Russia is cruel
Kremlin Russia continues to cultivate disastrous karma.
The EU and Trump are Quite now he couldn t say anything again now he doesn t See or Hear what Terrorist actions Zelensky and his goons are doing
These attacks were co ordinated by The West ....
And why did ukraine just smaggled the drones into russia then strikes when their near by airport!why dint they just deploy then inside ukraine into russia
Those Children we re forced into the army who didn t see videos of ppl even as 14yrs being forced to go fight to the front....
And that s the difference between Russia who bombs civilians and Ukriane who bombs the bombers bombing the civilians.
Zelensky a vile zionist who signed missiles in iIsrael to kill Palestinians is a USA puppet and needs to be ousted!
The response will be very devastating and catastrophic.
Ukraine needs to be in charge of NATO.
"Ukraine has made a BIG mistake, alarming for the whole world."
"Not bad for a guy with no cards . What do you think, Donnie?"
What air defence doing?
An annoying lapse of security that makes for good Ukraine PR but which does nothing to stop Russia from achieving its SMO objectives.
"This is no Ukrain and Russian war, because Europe directly involved given weapons to Ukrain that shows &quotYou fight on behalf of us, we will give you what you need.&quot Ukrain coukd nkt stand this long if they were not getting funds and weapons. You get my point."
"That’s definitely done with the help Ukraine,NATO nd the US intelligence so heads up to all"
Ukraine has Trucks as their aircraft careers
Putin’s blood pressure is probably currently at 180/120.
So... I dont think the Russia-Ukraine war will be ended soon.
"The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,"
"I really dont understand the stupid weakling mentality of Ukrainians. Russia bombs the Ukrainian capital Kiev into 2077 Cyberpunk ruins every day with various missile drones As a result, Ukraine did not bomb the Russian capital Moscow, which is only 600 kilometers away from the Russian-Ukrainian border, or the second largest city St. Petersburg, which is 800 kilometers away, but went to bomb the Arctic Circle airport 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers away? Since they can smuggle a whole truck of suicide bomb drones to the Arctic Circle, cant they smuggle 20 trucks of suicide bomb drones to Moscow or St. Petersburg?"
Propaganda. Mainstream media is full of propaganda for the so called west. Lies sells better than truth. Report on whats happening in The Nation of Palestine.
"Attacking one of Russia nuclear triad means giving the reason for Russia to use tactical nuclear weapon in the war. Ukraine trying to get an upperhand before the negotiation but Russia will demand more as retaliation. Ukarine, NATO, and UK are fighting the losing war with Ukrainian lifes."
"“The fight is here I need ammunition, not a ride,” -Zelensky"
Slava Ukraini! Heroiam Slava!
"Well, at least nobody can blame Trump for knocking off 20% of the world’s GDP. Cause that is what could happen if Russia responds to this appropriately."
Russia trying to cover it up
My condolences to Russia. Such an embarrassment is hard to bear 🥲
"This is an American, British and NATO terror attack, just like Nordstream, on its own Ukraine cannot do this, this act is to degrade Russian nuclear capability."
Maybe Russia knew something was up so they Ukraine hard recently especially the drone factory
I guess this means the talks have failed already! I dont know why America is pushing for WW3.
"The Russian nuclear legs are getting shorter. Soon they wont have one of three if Ukraine keeps destroying their bombers. Ukraine also attacked one nuclear sub, working on the second leg of Russias nuclear capabilities."
lol now westerners will cry when there will be no ukraine
This is America’s response to Putin jerking them around ! Ukraine does nothing without Trump giving the nod and helps with targeting etc
Operation Spiders Web
Do you mean children that were kidnapped according to the international law??
Ukrainians are Zionist and J ews. Do your research? President Putin is a world leader 🇷🇺 I love Russia 🇷🇺. Ukraine president is an Isrealihell demon 
"Well, let’s not complain when Russia hit back!"
Russia has drugged this war so when you stupid u pay the price. Embarrassing nothing else
"During soviet time, Ukraine produced thousands of scientists, huge industrial capabilities. And putin really belived that everything will go smoothly.In 5 years stalin took berlin, in 4 years putin cant take kharkiv which is in 20 kilometres from russian border.Total joke"
The war will escalate this year.
India still holds the record of destroying 11 air bases in one operation. Ukraine trying their best with support from European allies. TAcO  man will do a ceasefire just like he made between india and pakistan.
Your lower third is wrong. The Irkurtsk base is the far one. Murmansk is less than the 4300KM.
A Demilitarisation of Russia is going on by the plan
Amrica Israel jenoside in Gaza
World waar 3 starts amrica
And putin and 🇷🇺 still call nato patners very disgusting
Pootin said a 6 day operation! Its been 3 years!
Rossia will retaliate with the :&quotFront yellow back-down brown men underwear operation&quot.
"When you mess with Ukraine, you take the consequences. Now because of Putin, nowhere in Russia is safe. Nowhere."
"You got my attention and I am very proud you’re wise and very talented ( you &amp your team are brave dangerous to take on the current administration). If you didn’t announce this video and “fact check “ type of presentation, others are scared to do so. I pray for you and your team. We need your wisdom and bravery."
"Only 40? Ukraine should have said 100, since these clowns are just taking them at their word"
Something big is going to happen after this. Something so positive or something so bad.
"Winds, children of hurricanes, are approaching from the East, towards the makers of violence and death of the ""Maidanes"". From their arrogance of forces, who will prevail if they decide to play it all or nothing with their omnipotent and bestial gifts? The impassive, indifferent, will awaken in nightmare from their indifferent dreams. While the corroded ancient statues of imperial infernal egoisms collapse and fall into the abyss, dragging roots and bases with ancestral slaves, their pathetic agony with their typical colossal deaths."
"putin wanted this war and thinks nothing of killing innocent civilians, it is not quite so funny when it hits hard deep in russia,, putin can stop the war tomorrow if he wants but wont just to save his own ego."
Done by US in the name of Ukraine
Rest assured Putin will not be humiliated. WW3 is coming soon.
A very intelligent operation against military targets. Big difference from invader Putin who cowardly attacks sleeping civilians during the nights. Which is a war crime
US-NATO-Ukraine attacks on Russia not helpful. What if they return the favor ? What then?
so there are ukrainian drone operators inside russia?
There shouldnt have been such a strong attack during the negotiations. It looks like the war will escalate towards Europe instead of ending.
"Ukraine attacks military bases, Russia attacks civilian houses, hospitals, schools, etc."
Enjoy Russia this is whats called a special military operation
I think instead of an intelligence agency Russia has an agency of stupidity probably or everyone there is drunk
Putin is responsible for these escalations
"Ukraine has given its &quotMinerals&quot to USA, maybe thats why usa is helping Ukraine now."
You never want to strike a war with neighboring countries. I dont care who you are.
Once again Russia has shown levels of incompetence that are hard to ignore whether it was the invasion of cursed that they seemingly didnt know anything about before it happened or the latest attack on airfields and other examples can be given and you have to wonder why how in Gods name a country can allow this to happen when they are at War no wonder this war is going on and on like it has for the Great and Powerful nation that Russia is or is supposed to be these things keep happening and this last one is a really big setback for them lets make no doubt about it
Losing 40 planes in one day is huge.🇯🇲
"This is a lesson for President Putin to trust the West, especially America. They have done this kind of thing in the past. They stab us in the back by calling for an end to the war."
Without western collaboration it’s not possible
Russian military is pathetic. Shame
"The responsible to sabotage tomorrows talks in Turkey, is USA and the stupid Ukrainian so called presfient. He has bring the destruction very near of the area."
Guess Russia FAFO.
It was Trump who gave the order to bomb Russia to such depths in Siberia and Murmansk. Its obvious. Putin is a coward under the thumb of Trump and his neocons.
Dangerous development because Ukraine fights back?Only Russian plants are able to speak such utter nonsense.How much is Kremlin paying her?
I wish our US president was even half the man Zelensky is.
They used bombers to start Ukraine? I thought they used rockets and drones?
Behind every war there is Israiel if that is in Arab that is in Asia funding and supporting India for war and in Europe funding and supporting ukrine
I think this attack is made through the shift of USA’s policy on Russia. Trump’s gone back not attacking putin
"It is sad and shame for Russians, why Russia to move its NUK?"
Selva prove he always there for his country and people 
ALL supplied by NATO-US. Our corrupted and controlled US politicians are supporting and funding 2 evil wars and want to start a 3rd with Iran
The war came home to Russia.
"They could not do it Without US/ NATO drones , explosives and intel , and more than likely , NATO operators . When will Putin go a pair and take the gloves off ? He has to !"
"Ukraina is clever , smart to not waste simply ammo blind defend they homeland ...."
Is this an escalation to nuclear war?
Ukraine crossed the red line. The night can be tough for Ukraine now
"West is playing with fire, they want Russia to nuke Europe"
NATO attack. Gonna be consequences.
"While we have a traitor in the White House here, the Ukrainians are taking it to the Russian Military who keeps sending an average of over 1,000 soldiers to their death in Ukraine. Way to go Ukraine!!"
Looks like the Iskander will take revenge
Gloves are off. Ukraine will pay dearly for this.
Get up Ivan!
Putin is worried not to post the truth on media .Embarrassing for Putin and Ukraine don’t attack civilians like Russians
While Ukraine targeted airbase and aircraft now Russia will target civilian infrastructure and apartments
Russia have same defence system they give to India and when Pakistan hit Indian Rafael world and Ukraine found out this systems weakness now Russia should ask India and India should ask Russia meanwhile China is chilling with Pakistan and others😅
And Trump says he didnt know. The President of the US didnt know. Bet the CIIA did. World War 3 is coming to the Wests backyard.
"Ukraine has no such technology or capacity,so the west is behind,WWII inevitable"
next time ..... zelensky will be crying for ceasefire bcoz kyiv was attacked heavily
Can we call it The Day of Russian Aviation?
The only way Puter understands.
"This is the sign that Russians are playing soft in this war, while NATO and Ukraine are on War. Why Russia are playing nice to Ukraine and NATO"
This is indeed called Russia is being “Demilitarisation” by Ukraine 
happy retards are not able to predict the respond
"its mean, Russian will start WW3? did the drone is giving by US/ Europe to Ukraine?"
The weather forecast says it will be very hot in Ukraine next days
Response will be disastrous. Stop celebrating.
This is clear stupidity of Comedian Zelensky
Ukraine shd stop poking the dragon
"Overseen by Zelensky personally remember the outrageous conduct of Trump you dont have the cards, this is historic. Congratulations to Ukraine and war-time hero Zelensky."
I am gonna call this operation Tandoor. not Sindoor 
"NATO is putting a fight with anyone or any country that do not support its interest. NATO wants to rule the world and wanted everyone bow to it. NATO is no democracy and human rights. NATO cries for democracy and human rights if these benefit it. If democracy and human rights run counter to its interest, NATO is the greatest dictatorship and authoritarian alliance in disguise. NATO loses moral credibility. It has become an alliance of arrogance and wickedness. Many wars in Europe and elsewhere were created, instigated and promoted by NATO."
Israel the mastermind. Remember Israel was saying they will come for Russia
Regardless of where these attacks originated i dont see any excuse for not properly protecting those bases but maybe Im wrong
Al Jazeera deleting comments
War will escalate
Putin taking too long to long to flatten Ukraine . All show and no real substance.
Complete failure of Russian intelligence.
Nothing new. They been fighting for many years now so much property &amp lives gone but nothing new its all waste of lives money etc at the end of the day everything will be gone
"Dear Father, please give the Ukraine 🇺🇦 the strength of David, in Jesus name I pray, Amen"
The PutinBots and cowardly american MAGA knee-benders are seething in the comments right now lmao.
Nato is playing with fire..
Putins softness is Russias weakness..
trump : wow amazing wow
"Watching From South Africa,the people of Ukraine must let there president step down,to much people gonna die now over this strike,i wish this can come to end."
"Its not Ukrainian work, but CIA &amp Mi involve..."
"Do people today still think that drone attack was done by Ukraine? It is unbelievable. On the other hand, the signature id NATO is present and it is behind this attack."
"All these Ukraine bots in the comments . This has US and UK Intel hands all over it. This means nothing, Russia is still winning this war at an alarming kill rate."
Sorry for Ukrainians
This is of course Natos operation in the name of Ukraine...
I can see the outrage when the reply hits
"Zelensky told to poutine to stop or you will regret, now who have the cards hey Donald "
Poohtin worshipping trolls are getting mad 
Kiev doesnt want any peace. Ok.
Agent Krasnov told Zelenskyy in the White House:“You’ve got no cards!”Now Putin just lost most of his cards!Putin just FAFO!Ukraine’s little SMO!
Putin wants to take over Ukraine or if he can’t he will pound it to dust like Gaza or Syria .
"I am waiting to see how the Russian talking heads, the scott ritters, and rest will Spin this"
When you play with destruction with your neighbour you must expect the same reaction from them .All of Ukraine was once the Russia Empire as was Poland Before WW2 most countries had integrated populations Putin and Zelenskyy should make part of Russia neutral and part of Ukraine neutral so they can live together in harmony.
Well hows that going to affect Trumps expertise at peace negotiations?Send TACO TRUMP in the mix.
Now when Russia wil response they all will play victim card
"Just imagine... you are a russian soldier, chilling at an airbase 4300km away from war and suddenly everything around you explodes."
How can you not mention the 1400 missiles launched by Ukraine into Russia in the weeks prior to the Russian escalation? Or the assassination attempt on Putin?
Using a disguised civilian truck to enter enemy territory and deploy FPV drones for attacks would constitute perfidy and be a violation of the Geneva Conventions. It could be classified as a war crime.
"I am starting to believe, the formidable KGB that we thought were Russians were almost all Ukrainians"
"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, are you a member of the secret society skull and bones aka brotherhood of death?"
Ukraine can not do this alone.
Why is Russia trying to destroy ukraine?
"This is certainly a very successful operation carried out by Ukraine. It is not exactly like Pearl Harbor, but it is a very painful blow to the pride of the Bear and Moscow. But now, of course, after such an event, no one can talk about a truce at all, at least in the near future between Moscow and Kiev. Kyiv has certainly added fuel to the fire. It is possible that many countries will probably soon, if not ban, then at least limit the production and use of FPV drones. Earlier, I wrote that the president or high-ranking official of any country is no longer safe, despite the fact that they are well guarded. Can you imagine a well-planned action using drones against anyone or anything? I also wrote that with the help of such drones, one can effectively attack military bases, industrial centers and warehouses with goods, although previously these quadcopters were produced exclusively as a peaceful gadget and a toy for adults. It should be noted that politicians, businessmen and other interested parties who control the production of very expensive aircraft of various types and profit from their sales may also be concerned and against the further spread of such literally penny drones, which may minimize their greedy plans to profit from the sale of human-controlled aircraft, which in most cases are unreasonably expensive military aircraft with questionable efficiency, as practice shows. That is, by advertising such new samples of super-duper technologies to the public, as if these are new technologies that the country can be proud of, and as if they provide new jobs. But in fact, these lying and greedy people make money at the expense of taxpayers money by providing false information...."
I am pretty sure this was done by British MI6 and French Special Forces. Ukraine has no more soldiers left
Donald trump is forcing russia to negotiation table
"Russian: plz buy Indian defence system which neutralized 99.9% of drones missiles from Pakistan. It has integrated all radars ranges, interceptor, missiles with central control unit called AKASHTEER. It integrated S400, BARAK, AKASH, L70 in one system. This is better than iron dome, patriot."
"Russia being humbled in the most embarrassing way. Zelensky is the modern world’s greatest wartime leader. The burden this man carries in so many respects, including overseeing this operation. How dare Trump and JD Vance belittle him the way they did."
"This was Nato attacking Russia nuclear triad not Ukraine. This was never a Ukraine war and it was always a Nato war. They are trying to take out Russia nuclear bombers to pave the way for a nuclear decapitation strike that will happen under Trump. He hinted at that already. Lets be honest, the war is not ending, it is advancing to the final round which will be a nuclear apocalypse. This is all part odmf a Demonic plan by the west to bring about the end of the world."
Wait for Russias retaliation
So if the rockets fly to Kiev in large amounts stop crying about it
This is a sign of 3rd world war
I bet you the Americans had nothing to do with this..
Putin should of taken that ceasefire. Ukrainians just got themselves a bargining chip because thats only 40% of its bomber fleet
"not blaming israel for this...? whats the matter? do you feel ok....AL JAZEERA? need some tea?31dead in aid center is gaza is israel, Ha? HAMAS IS MASSACARING IS OWN PEOPLE, and you blame israel for this. even when arabs butcher... other arabsm israel is blamed."
Tom Cruise has aged significantly since the release of the last Mission Impossible movie. 🫣
Putin got caught with his pants down. Thats what happens when you have a boyfriend named Donny Trump. Gloria to Ukraine
Some news to say Ukraine still alive. Loser country now begging Russia.
The putlerism-neonazism will fall. People are fed up with putlerism-neonazism and trumpism-neofascism
The ukranian bots d*ck riding on the chat is funny
I think putting will know he has lost this special operation.Military assets is gone.
Muslim traitor in russia
Ukraine with the active assistance of the West is trying to attack the Russian military assets to weaken it. Russia should abandon the policy of restraint before its too late.
"I have never seen a country full of FOOLS and JOKERS. Ukrain do no even know what they are fighting for. They lost 50% resources to USA. And now, invited more devastations again..what for? USA Supremacy..Ego of one ruling joker is costing lives in Ukrain"
Those children (russian speaking) have been evacuated from the war zones
Childrens wrre shaved from the sries that russia INVADED....uts like robers just saving money from a robbery the are convinced
This war will not end soon 
"Had Russian intelligence been apprised of Ukraines plans, they would have found them utterly improbable."
That State of the art Russian S400-500-600 missile defence system is really getting a good return on its investment.
"One thing Russians should understand is, there will be no peace in their country if any part of Ukraine is taken. No part of Russia will be safe as Ukrainians will be scattered everywhere."
Ukrainian are real worriers
Ironically we never saw russia hitting Ukrainian bases..In the media only Russia hit civilians but Ukraine only hits the bases
Nato trying to make the perfect drone so they dont stop war
"The prove Ukraine never stop bombing, or making terror act in Russia killing civilians. Expired Zelenskie do everything not making Peace deal at all. And always playing victim."
I know two things1-That attack made by USA-UK cooperation.2-Russias response will be scary!
Who provided this location? Russia have rights to take bold step.
Why dont the Russian people / soldiers rally/ protest for Putin to stop the war?
wow amazing russian air defense. the most incompetent army in the world lmao
It will be nice from here Hopefully Zelensky n the west will not say anything about Russia retaliation
"Reports have said four airfields.However footedge shows aircraft NOT in revetments which is just foolish when on a wartime footing. Foolish, incredulous to the point of making any reporting accurate"
The operation was called WEB. Change one letter in the Ukrainian word for web and replace with U and youll get Putin.
"ARE YOU ALL OUT OF YOUR MINDS? WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO START WW3? TOTAL ANNIHILATION, MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION, CAN YOU GUYS ALL CHILL? WE JUST WANT TO LIVE OUR LIVES STILL."
"let us list the facts and you can decide who you think is winning in the Russo-Ukraine war.Russia invaded and occupied 38% of Ukraine in early 2022, but by October 22 after retreating in the east and up to today in 2025 they only managed to hang on to just 17%. Thats a decrease in the Russian temporarily occupied territories of 61%% ! (in real terms Russia in 3 years has only captured 10% new territory in Ukraine. heres why thats a fact - In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea - 4.7% of Ukraine. between 2015 &amp 2021 Russia occupied part of Donetsk (Donbas) - 2.3% of Ukraine, that equals 7% already occupied, prior to the 2022 invasion, meaning Russia has only captured 10% new territory in 3yrs 3months of war ! 😳 😲)Russia got defeated at Kyiv and had to retreat back to Belarus !Russia got defeated in Sumi and Kharkiv and ran away into Kursk and Belgorod leaving millions of tons of equipment for Ukraine !Russia got defeated in Kherson and had to retreat back across the Dnieper River !Ukraine invades Kursk in Russia and captures in 9 days, more territory than Russia captured in Donbas over 2 years !who do you think is winning the land war?Ukraine made Sevastapol in Crimea untenable for the Black Sea Fleet, making them leave their major regional naval base !Ukraine has in dock and on the open sea sunk or neutralised 450,000 tons of Russias black sea fleet, approx 67% of the fleet is unusable!Ukrainian activities in the Black Sea has forced the Russian black sea fleet to retreat all the way (600km east) to Novorossiysk in Russia.The Russian black sea fleet has barricaded itself inside Novorossiysk harbour to stop drones attacks from Ukraine, scared to come out.Ukraine has made the Black and Azov Seas untenable for Russias mighty black sea fleet and taken control the Black Sea region.who do you think is winning the sea war ?Russias air space force in January 2022 was 7 times bigger than Ukraines.Russia has lost 408 planes, 392 helicopters and 616 pilots in 3 years 3 months of war.Russian airforce wont fly in Ukraine air space for fear of being shot down by Ukraines air defence systems.in 3 years 3 months of war, out numbering Ukraines air force 7 : 1, Russia HAS NOT managed to take control of Ukraines airspace.Russia cant make enough planes to replace those being shot down or destroyed, but Ukraine has received new planes from their supporters.so who do you think is winning the air war?on top of this Russian casualties currently exceed 990,000+ soldiers and military equipment losses over 160,000+ pieces.You might want to re-evaluate your understanding of what has been going on and whos winning this fight!"
"Amazing operation. The Ukrainians carry out crazier missions every month and this has to be their masterpiece so far. The ocs were so worried about long distance large drones that they missed the trucks parked next to the airfields with small drones. Over 40 russian planes destroyed so far, and most likely, there are more. Its crazy how a small country thats only 35 years old can become a world leader in modern warfare in 4 years out of necessity. Drone warfare is the latest of modern warfare and Ukrainiane is the leader. Sure, America and other countries have big drones, but i would rather have a million small and cheap drones than a 1000 large drones. Large drones are not disposable and expensive and can be spotted on radar so naturaly the owners will keep it out of any risky situations while small drones are disposable and you can use a dozen of them on a single target."
This seems like more an airfield special military operation
Jocker has struck a hammer on his own toes
"When Russia gives the same favour back to Ukraine, Zelensky will start to cry out"
RIP Ukraine now its really going to humiliating for your country
"Excellent. And, as opposed to Russia, they didnt attack civilians."
"Stupid. Ask yourself this : White Christians killing White Christians, who benefits ?"
This is a big blow to o Putin.....so he thinks he can fight with NATO
Trump will cry for his criminal friend Putin 
Can Ukraine Sustain a Retaliatory Attack by Russia After this Provocation?
This will make Russia stronger not weaker.
This couldnt happen without specialist western help specifically targeting and operational aid.So when Russ14 decides to hit back hard watch the West cry and scream foul.This war is being made worse and kept going because of the west.Idiots
DEMOCRACY is action.
"Where was air defense ? these drones are doing what 5 squadrons of fighter jets could not do, maybe this event will change war fighting strategies on out. How do you protect air fields against drones??"
"H-3 airstrike, Ukraine edition.This strike is equivalent to the Iranian airstrike on the H-3 airbase during the Iran-Iraq war."
Are they going to turkey again for peace talk?
SURRENDER NOWWIN YOUR STATE HOOD
Nuclear was in two weeaks
"These planes are called the Bear long range nuclear bombers, some reports say 40 were destroyed."
Now watch out for Oreshnik rockets
"Ukraine is helping Russia join the peace talks, nice of them."
Now world knows .. who is the real joker
USA double game playing 
Russia will respond in a big way of course.
King Cyrus aka Trump better step up
Ukrainian military intelligence is no joke
"Putin might not be happy and will counter big while grabbing more lands.Ceasefire wont happen anytime soon, only either 1 surrender."
Trump i will stop the war day 1 but bs we already going to WW3 UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINITRATION WW3 WILL START UNDER THEM WHYYYYYYYY
Russia must not spare Ukraine.Putin must go in hard otherwise he will regret
Norway. Murmansk is close to Norway border.
This is the sign of weakness of Russia!! Now we know that Russia is not a Superpower country!!Very poor defense ang too much poor war strategies!!!
I guess Ukraine does have some pretty good cards…
Its not Ukraine But NATO. This cannot be done with NATO nations participation of course.
"So, a NATO operation using special operators entering and exiting the country from either Finland or the Baltics."
Well return on investment.. Russia said it is demilitarizing Ukraine. Now who is being demilitarized?
Finland must have helped.
Wait for the retaliation by Russia.
"There are videos out that show drones being launched from the trailers of semi-trucks. They drove them all the way there, and the tops of the trailers opened up and launched the drones. Wild."
I wonder what the response will be.Has Ukraine gone too far. We will see the outcome soon
"Nothing about this attack makes sense. Big planes aren’t used widely anymore. Plus, radar was not tracking anything? Plus they left them parked like it’s an air show? Sounds like an allowed red flag…"
"No matter how strong you are, you arent fighting unless your opponent is fighting back. Anything less is bullying, oppression, abuse, and cowardice, and nothing more."
This will only force Russia to escalate.
I am afraid what Putin going to reply.
"The West is continuously provoking and sabotaging and therefore wants the third world war, not peace!!"
"This is an interesting concept of &quotfight for freedom.&quot Being so far away from the front means that this is out of bounds on any means. I wonder what retaliation will be. Of course let us not forget that the goal of this ardent attack is to spread fear and derail any peace process. A peace process that is not mutual. It is a pity that people rejoice at terror acts and killing of other people. Watching it from the armchair as if this was some kind of a TV contest. And even if everything goes well, the average person gets the fallout from any military action. Those at the affected villages and cities will tell the real truth. Those who rejoice forget that their taxes go to kill other people instead of developing their own countries. This is like the Game of Thrones. Watching a movie with a sick content and even paying for it.... I advise all of the happy people to go to Ukraine or Russia and see what is truly happening. All the media is doing is inciting brothers and sisters to kill each other, so that the third party can have the benefits of the misery of the other two."
Ukraine is finished its made a big mistake
USA sponsored wars are a threat to all of.They are so stupid to tempt Putins patience.
Ukraine is helping Russia demilitarize
zelansky is a moron he doesnt want peace if he did he would provoke Putin
This reminds me pearl harbour. Hope this conflict ends here.
Allah akbar ! 🇺🇦🇺🇦
"Ukraine, be Israel, Say nothing, confirm nothing"
Ukraine could keep this secret for a year because the only war on msm is Gaza
No more Ukraine personal opinion
"Russia is the most weirdest country I have ever seen in my life. Beyond comprehension. You cant believe how stupid the inhabitants are, if there was a drone swarm in direction to moscow the people would still act like there is nothing happening literally brain dead. If russia didnt have any nukes they would loose on every front. The US would annihilate them."
Russia: dont look up. also Russia: FAFO
Russia will respond by targeting none military targets . They will do terrorism in response...
Russia is not ready for this.
Would be interested to hear a dollar value assessment of the damage. Has to be huge
I Am indian but suport gaza jay hind
Where is S 400 air defense......India can protect from Pakistan....why not Russia so funny
Red flag russian inside job
Time for Russia to retaliate!!!
This is distance London and Moscow it is impossible
"Trump is fooling Putin and the power who run america behind walls want wars zelensky natanyahu both r puppets of this power, in short zionist is trying to implement Israel new world order these zionist extremist is also pushing poor modi for war, people should see the prediction in Jews holy books and compulsory watch DR.Israr Ahmed lectures in YouTube"
Ukraine is clearly badassforsure.
Ukraine are playing with the tail of a lion expect the worst from Russia....
The operation was next level.And Trump said Ukraine has no cards.
Stop the war save the children &amp woman both sides.we want to peace M Iqbal from USA philidhalipa N 7 street
And then there will be a respond and.......the cycle continues
This is a very dangerous step taken by Ukraine. Russia can even drop a nuclear weapon any moment.
To all Ukrainian fans. Look at the map and just shut up. Losers cheering all day long.
"The Istanbul talks are just a way for Russia to give the orange r@pist a way to say Russia wants peace and then blame Ukraine for not surrendering to all the demands. Anyone with over 4 brain cells knows the only peace Russia wants is for half of Europe to surrender to the Tsar, starting with Ukraine. Shame on USA for supporting Russia."
Those airplanes were moved to those locations far from the Ukrainian border to protect them from theese kind of attacks…you can call it a major score…
At that moment Russian media large amount of it is calling for nuclear retaliation &quot World is going insane ? Peace is only answers !
Trump: You dont have the cardsZelensky: Hold my beer
Ukraine is a surrogate of USA. Trump is now playing a dangerous game.
4 bases at once…that’s a slapdown
Zelensky is war monger man.Never wants peace in the world.
The Russian Air bases successfully intercepted incoming missiles and drones.
Launched nearby.C I A.Seems US Deep State has enlisted Trump.Ukraine hasnt any capability to launch drones within Russia. Only a combo of CIA and US Air Force could infiltrate Russian air bases.
"Zelensky, the comedian, Mr. Putin, is also Zelensky the script writer! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA "
We all believe garbage Ukraine. Propaganda from losing country. Fake country losing land everyday and no option than now beg Russia for peace.
Russias big mistake is attacking civilians. Thats why people support Ukraine. Russians will never recover under Putin.
"Military targets , military targets , military targets , Ukraine attacks military targets NOT civilian targets 🇬🇧🇺🇦"
Free Ukraine 🇺🇦Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Ukrainian drone attack??? You mean NATO drone attack. Trump effectively shot down Ukraines access to Elon Musks SpaceX spy satellite surveillance of Russian territory. So stop this nonsense about Ukraines capability to hit targets deeb inside Russia +4000 km from Ukrainian boarders. Its a NATO EU lead operation. Pure and simple.
Putin looking weak af. Russia needs a stronger leader
Retaliation from Russia is a big concern now.
I always emphasize that Russian only boasts about nukes and commencing WWW3 and have no other agenda.
18 months in planning? Could this so called war be any more protracted?
Zelensky has the scalpel at Putins testicles!....
Zelensky destroying Ukraine to make happy USAGermany France UK sacrificing Ukraine military personals and Citizens to weaken Russia but Zelensky not thinking about Russias Heavy Retaliation which is Nuclear Power... Ukraine Citizens must pull down Zelensky from Power to save Ukraine to be occupied Fully by Russia
Stop the old zar wanna be now!
"Russia needs to make some Ukrainian glass, green-glass."
Russia is s winner country
People love to write off the Ukrainians and then they just keep proving them wrong this is massive imagine if America had half their nuclear bombers destroyed on the ground amazing
This could lead all of us to WWII
Israel behind ukrane training
War will continiue now.
Russia must be thinking whos helping from within
David and Goliath comes to mind but instead of a stone its a drone 
to bad trump wasnt there with his boy putie
This here is about pushed Putin to the edge. If he does not make mess now his ppl won’t understand him anymore. And nato was trying hard to achieve it Whoever called this shots is the one who wants to prevent peace at all cost Probably dollar ownersThey got beautiful luxury bunkers for their families
Ukrain is committing suicide!
"Everyone, just all go home."
This is civil war now.
putins 2 week special military operation isnt going so well
mandatory military draft for all white european men NOW!
Wasn’t Trump supposed to stop the war in 24 hours ?
"Who has gone crazy now,, "
I wonder why chyna isnt helping russia
"Hey Russia, how is your 3 day Special military operation coming along ???? hahahah"
They will cry to America when Russia retaliates
HOW EMBARASSING RUSSIA haahahahaha
Isn’t this a war crime?
They will cry to America when Russia retaliates
There is no appetite for peace here. This war is about to go nuclear.
Ukraine’s just responding with the only language Russia understands
The West will keep fighting for the Russian resources to the last Ukrainian.
Russian army is the nr. 2 army in...Russia (after Ukraine).
Putin is Disaster for Russia 🇷🇺.Free Russia 🇷🇺  from Putin
The war began in 2014 when the Ukrainian military began shelling the Russian speaking population of Donbass 
Ukraine just committed suicide.
Putin will not finish the year.
This is what happens when you invade another mans land. Russia should ask for peace. Its time for a peace deal.
ukies celebrating small victories then cry on 10x larger scale consequences: Russia is cruel
Kremlin Russia continues to cultivate disastrous karma.
The EU and Trump are Quite now he couldnt say anything again now he doesnt See or Hear what Terrorist actions Zelensky and his goons are doing
These attacks were co ordinated by The West ....
And why did ukraine just smaggled the drones into russia then strikes when their near by airport!why dint they just deploy then inside ukraine into russia
Those Children were forced into the army who didnt see videos of ppl even as 14yrs being forced to go fight to the front....
And thats the difference between Russia who bombs civilians and Ukriane who bombs the bombers bombing the civilians.
Wait for feedback.u will start claiming mbu russia is targetting civilians
It was shows how Ukraine doesnt need Peace
Hhmmm. I guess it’s just a coincidence that that this coincides with Putin making Trump look stupid trying to negotiate a peace deal .
U in kiev? Runnnn
Russia having effective air defense challenge: Impossible
They have spies in Russia.
Even Russia cant defend themselves using s-400 but india insists that they deflected every attack from Pakistan. Wow
that joker did it again. putin will laugh out hard
Everything is going according to plan now....Zelenskys plan!
Ahahahahahaha
Fake video
Ukraine has no elections. How sad.
tge world expects putin to accept negotiations abd ceasefire. it is only reasonable to let this be
Lesson for Russia for neglecting security protection..too busy at the border but fail to protect air base..
Not ukraine but masked Nato
Zelensky doesnt want negotiations. They are sabotaging the planned negotiations in Turkey their intention seems that Russia will cancel them.
"a very long match,who win the winner cup,"
"Russia is such a joke, they attack children and civilians and cant even protect their nuclear bombers."
"Russia now has the second most powerful military in Russia, you reap what you sow."
Most days id be embassaed to be Russian but id be especiialy embarassed today . Clown army.
Kiev about to have a real bad time
Hello we are sorry to announce a breaking news. Putin used nukes on Ukraine  this is emergency broadcast 
"Tomorrows breaking news,,,&quotRUSIA POUNDERS UKRAINES ALL MILITARY AIRPORTS&quot"
let Russia and ukriane go at each other ... USA should withdraw ALL support and sit quite regardless of NATO ... Nato should NOT over-ride common sense ... !
well...ukraine needs to brace themselfs now and wait for the worse
BYE BYE PUTIN....... YOUR OLD DAYS AND YOUR OLD WAYS ARE NUMBERED!!!
This is one of the most creative hits on the russian military. This is why russia cannot win. The UKS made weapons for the ussr and now we are seeing why.
Big Russian security lapses
"Wasn’t Russia heavily criticized for launching air attacks during negotiations? But now Ukraine launches air attacks the day before negotiations a,d that’s a good thing?"
2 billion in strategic assets destroyed by cheap drones rigged to blow. 21st century warfare is interesting to say the least
Ukraine should not cry when Russia answers this attack. You cannot fight a superpower.
Free Palestine
I dont think this is good for Ukraine. The statehood of Ukraine is under question. The west and Ukraine are ignorant about Russias nukes!
NOW TRUMP KNOWS WHY ZELENSKY WEARS HIS UNIFORM. THIS IS MASSIVE AND IMPRESSIVE. VIVA UKRAINE.
Fake news. Is AI
War Please no war
"So, everything is unconfirmed? What Ukraine sources told you anything? Seems like Russia bombed their own airbases. This gives them the excuse to attack Ukraine! And, Russian air power is of no consequence to this war, so blowing up aircraft is mostly meaningless. I dont think Ukraine wasted resources on this. They dont have the resources to justify these actions. Maybe they take credit for it anyway. Why not? Like the 2 trains in Russia. FSB did all of these attacks. No pilots or ground crew were injured in airbase attacks???"
This could be Russia’s Pearl Harbour.
Russia hasnt announced anything!!! Theyre hiding behind Putlers skirt.
Ukraine made a big mistake !
This wouldnt have been possible without the help of the West and Russia will see it as that and will retaliate hardly on Ukraine soil!
Time for Russia to pull the big bear out
Ukraine bombs military targets while russia kills civilians.
"Most people on here are just extremely stupid. Not just stupid extremely stupid and brainwashed. Clearly, no history education whatsoever...."
Dangerous pokes
"LOOK at all the Zionist unit 8200 in the comments....hilarious. The world isnt stupid, we dont like Zionist USA/izrael/ukraine."
"Its a major loss of face for Putin. And it destroyed billions in value, a Tu-160M costs 270 million dollars each. Strategically it might not have much impact as russia is slowly building new T160M. Except maybe forcing them to redeploy air defense from the front."
Alemanha anuncia que Kiev já pode usar as suas armas na Rússia. 26/05/2052.
This is how «специальная военная операция» is done!
"Wonderful! Murmansk is east of the Norwegian border with Russia, ie, in the Arctic"
Now Russia headed for peace talks in Turkey after the pounding.
Hardly every see them giving news in an unbiased way.
"This operation is Mission Impossible type stuff, wild"
Crocodillo Bombardilo was also destroyed
